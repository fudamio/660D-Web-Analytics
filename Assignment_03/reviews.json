good deal.  I collect LED flashlights and have about 30 right now but I really like these smaller ones because I can just keep them in my pocket.These are heavy duty and made with aluminum.  The battery compartment has an O ring to keep moisture out.  They are waterproof but not to be submerged in water but they will withstand rain.The beam is adjustable and you can see that in the video I provided to go with this review and I also show all 3 modes of lighting.  All you need to do is slightly tap the on and off switch and it will change modes.Please watch the video to get a better idea of what I am talking about.  Overall it is excellent for the price and you get 2!  I give this 5 stars easily.  I hoped this helped in some way.","1":"Given my many prior, poor experiences with several of the low-price\/knockoff CREE type LED, zoomable style flashlights I've bought of this design, these lights are a surprisingly good purchase.  I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's\/CON's list below:CONS:1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the \"Amazon Basics\" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1\/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.PROS:1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &\/or walking our dog after dark.2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design\/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!Overall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality..","2":"This is great flashlight for the price.I got this flashlight for my toolbox in the truck.  It works great, it\u2019s small and economical.This flashlight can run on either one of these batteries:* 1 size AA (regular 1.5v battery), easy to find and cheap.or* 1 size 14500 (3.7v battery), harder to find and more expensive, but brighter.Depending on the battery you use, the light is dimmer or brighter:a) On a single AA battery, I would estimate 130 lumens.  To me this is very bright on a single regular battery. I compared to another light I have that is advertized as 130 lumens by Energizer, it is very close to the same brightness in my opinion.  To me 130 lumens is great task lighting.b) On a single 14500 battery, the company claims 300 lumens and I believe it.  300 lumens is INTENSE, probably TOO much for task lighting.  You likely would like this more for walking in the dark, where the light is out away from you more.Other points:a) Uses a 3 click switch.  Press once for full brightness.  Press quickly twice for1\/2 brightness.  3 times for fast blinking at full bright.b) The front of the flashlight pulls in\/out to focus the beam.  It works well and stays where you put it.c) The light color is a slight shift towards blue from absolute white.  But nothing extreme.d) Has a tail cap pushbutton switch is encased in rubber. This is great for one-handed operation.e) Doesn't easily do \"momentary on\". Momentary on is when it comes on by slightly pressing the switch and goes off when you release it. This light comes on when you release the button, not when you push it down. Fellow flashlight geeks call that a \"reverse clicky\".f) Says it\u2019s water resistant, but I doubt it is water proof.  However, I didn\u2019t dunk test it for water proof for fear of ruining it.","3":"Even though, the wide angle gives a decent spray of light. With a fresh battery, these lights struggled to light the bushes from 50 yards away. That does not mean if you want to use these babies in the attic, while checking the rat traps, you wont have great light, but when you zoom the lens for a tighter Beam... you'll find a \"square\" which is emitted by the LED module\/crystal. Which is okay, (for kids) but not great if you need to really see that \"thing\" that is right there... LOOKIN BACK AT YOU ......  All in all, this is great deal for a four pack of flashlights that you can give to the kids for a camping trip, to keep them all on the same wave, but if you're looking for something else to keep you out of the dark, and give yourself a chance to stay ahead of the critters... try something else.","4":"These are good quality tactical flashlights. They have three modes and in the video I am posting along with this review you can see the difference in the 3 modes which are changeable with a click of the button at the end of the flashlight. There is a sturdy pocket clip mounted to the side of the flashlights with two small screws. So far I haven't had any problems with the flashlights which seem to be pretty durable and are just what I expected.","5":"These ended up being very handy, but I didn't realize how small they would be. To be fair to the manufacturer I probably didn't grasp what the dimensions they posted really meant so it's in. I way their fault. For those of you who are not as found of math or lack basic sense of  spatial awareness (like me), these little guys are about palm size. Maybe a little smaller or bigger depending on your body proportions, but that's my best comparison out the gate.All that being said these are some nifty flashlights. They have a bright, medium, and strobe setting which you change by halfway pressing the power button. I found that out a bit of a startling way, but was none the less impressed. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.","6":"These are small enough to carry in a purse or backpack. I personally carry one in my purse for those times when I am going to my car late in the evening and need a light to see.  I take evening classes and sometimes going to my car is a little scary, so I really like having the flashlight readily available. It eases my stress and fears waking to my car being able to actually see.  We recently lost power and I used my rockbird flashlight most of the evening. I was amazed at how long and well it worked. I am very happy with these flashlights and look forward to using them for camping and hiking over the summer. I am impressed for as small as they are, they emit quite a bit of light.","7":"Handy little flashlights and I thought the clip would be great for for those times I don't happen to have pockets.  So far I found that the metal bar is so tight that I can't it to clip on any clothing and I am afraid to pry it open too far in case it snaps off.I also received one that was great and one that was significantly dimmer.  Can't blame the batteries as I switched them out with the same results.If they were both the same intensity I would rate them 5 stars.","8":"Don't be fooled by their small appearance they pack a punch! Liked the fact that two came in a package. They are small enough that I kept one in my glove box in my car and one in the bathroom vanity in our upstairs bathroom.  When the electricity goes out it always seems like I can never find the flashlights now I have them on every level of my home. With one simple Double A battery they are ready to go.  They really give off a lot of light for a small flashlight.  I also like the fact that they have a setting that is like a strobe light.  That is why I decided to keep one in the car if we ever get stuck in the dark it can be used to flag someone down. I will be purchasing more of these!","9":"i gave it 3 stars because only one of the flash lights worked.  it didnt seem worth it to send them back since i really only needed one for a Christmas gift, just seemed easier and cheaper to get the two pack.  I put the batteries in and one worked right away while the other only pretends to work if the spring touches the side wall while the battery is in it and that's impossible to use since you have to close the cap to keep the battery inside.  The one that works however is awesome and more than what i expected it to be, flashes, zooms and expands and is very bright for its small size. just wish the other one worked. overall happy with the one that works but disappointed only one worked","10":"Really love these little flashlights, they're the best I've found on market. Small, VERY powerful for their size, focusable and only require one AA battery.Why not 5 stars? Because of the three modes that you must cycle through every time. I have a couple of flashlights that stay in the same mode unless you repeatedly press the button, and then stay in that mode until changed again. That's the way all of these should work. It's a real pain to have to click so many times, just to get back to the only setting I'll use: high. Make that change and I'll buy a dozen for everyone in the family.","11":"I ordered similar lights to this in the past... LOVED THEM!  These however constantly cycle the features each time you turn the light on.For example:First time you turn it on... Super bright.Next time... Dim mode.Next time... Flashing pattern.NORMALLY... These types of flashlights should function:Momentary press button = Changes mode.Turn unit off = Remembers where it was.","12":"This is my new EDC replacing the Tank007 703.  I don't know why but I just love it.  As any flashaholic knows, a flashlight is personal, especially one of few that gets carried around every day.  I think I like the feel and the grip and the wide flood the most.  Highly recommend!Now on to the more practical part of the review so people can make an educated decision:- This indeed runs well and bright on a Liion 3.7V 14500 battery and is much brighter- The 14500 battery doesn't last long; in fact it lasts a bit less than my 10440 in my Tank 703- The zoom becomes a bit loose after a while but not in a bad way, just easier to move and more prone to move when you don't want it.- Mine arrive in full working order, my father in law's arrived Dead and he had to RMA it.  Set your expectations low and you will be surprised.- When zoomed out it is a great soft and beautiful flood light.  When zoomed in to around 80% it is nice and focused and a good beam pattern with soft edges.  When fully zoomed in it is a large magnification of the emitter and an ugly square with lines just like the emitter is.  It doesn't bother me but should be stated for those purists out there that look strongly at beam pattern.- It is a little heavy light for its size and quite thick compared to most 14500 lights but also feels short (don't think it is though).  It feels more like a CR123 light.  Kinda cool and refreshing- Reverse clicky (what would you expect for $5) but it is a good tailcap that can stand.- Threads are fairly smooth but the spring catches as you unscrew and makes it feel gritty when it really isn't.- Anodizing is surprisingly strong as I have it in my pocket with lots of other metal lights and knives and all the rest are now black and silver were the coating has rubbed off this is solid and nothing has come off in several months.  Impressive!Overall it isn't the most competent light on the planet and a far cry from a high-end fenix light but for $5 and all the things it does right I would highly recommend it.  Worst case it is a conversation piece, best case it becomes your new EDC like me.","13":"Great deal for a pair of mini flashlights.  Very small and lightweight so very easy to throw in your purse to have just in case or around the house if the power goes out.  Fits in the palm of my hand.  Takes just one double AA battery.  Very bright and you can adjust to turn it even brighter.  Pictures I've taken below are in pitch black so you see how bright they are.","14":"These flashlights work really well. The are heavy duty metal so they feel like they will take some abuse and not break. They get very bright which is obviously what you want from a flashlight. You get 2 so its a good value for your money. I keep one in the car for emergencies and my husband has the other one. I think these will last a very long time.","15":"These flashlights aren't as bright as I expected, but they work. I don't really like how each press of the power button cycles through the three settings (bright, dim, flashing). When I press the power, I expect it to always start on the bright setting, but it doesn't. It goes to whatever setting was next in the rotation. It's not a big deal, but it's a little annoying.I would give these 3 stars, but the good price point bumps it up to 4. I didn't pay much for these, so they're mostly worth the price. I have another small flashlight I much prefer, but it was also a lot more expensive.","16":"These flashlights are not actually 300lumens. They are not even 200 lumens. When compared to other 300 lumen and a 200 lumen flashlight I found that with new batteries at its highest setting folly zoomed in, was still visibly dimmer than the 200 lumen flashlight. I bought the two pack, and compared both to each other with both new alkaline and fully charged nickle-cadmium rechargeable batteries and found that they do not even match each other in brightness. They're inexpensive, and were the compact size I was looking for, but it seems you get what you pay for, and in this case you pay for under 200 lumens.","17":"Very well made aluminium tube and very bright. What more could you want? Well, maybe a bigger flashlight. These things are tiny but crank an amazing amount of light given their size. Good for car, purse or pocket. Or to clip on your belt. The ability to focus the beam from narrow to wide is a plus. Be sure to wait for the sales. Prices are all over the map on these things, from as little as $8 (for 2) to almost $30. A good deal at the lower price point.","18":"These are very small flashlights. They feel very solid though, and the illumination is great for the size. They easily clip inside the pocket of a pair of jeans and feel very similar to a clipped folding knife in my pocket. The housing at the end of the light slides in and out to adjust the beam, and there is a strobe setting on the light when you press the power button off and on again. Two lights come in the package. At first it seemed a little spendy for them when looking at their size, but as I have used it, and had it in my pocket, these are 20 times the light you get at a dollar store, or by spending less somewhere else. I bought 3 packs of 2. They have held up under the abuse my son's and friends dish out so far. And, they are very compact.","19":"I always like to keep a small flashlight in my handbag in case of emergencies- you never know when an elevator will have a power outage or when you'll get stuck outside after dark. These are perfect for that purpose- they're lightweight enough yet comfortable to hold. I like that it comes in a pack of two, so I have a backup. The clip allows me to attach it to the pocket in my handbag for easy retrieval. And for a small flashlight, the LED light is strong, so I can see myself holding this for a long time in case of a power outage, unlike other powerful flashlights that are large, bulky and heavy.","20":"We often need to head outdoors with no prior warning to deal with issues with the farm animals.  A bright, reliable flashlight that can slip into a pocket is a must for us.Shipping was fast with Amazon Prime and the packaging was excellent.  These flashlights did not come with batteries, but I had some on hand for the flashlights we already own.These flashlights are lightweight and very, very bright.  The adjustable beam allows us to search the woods quickly and then to pinpoint what we're searching for.  Most recently that was a wild raccoon who was tipping our waste cans and stealing food from the barn cats.The clips are strong, enabling us to ensure that the flashlights won't fall out of our pockets while we're working.I have absolutely no complaints and intend to buy these again!","21":"These are very lightweight and last forever on a single AA battery.I use them for evening strolls around (an increasingly dark as winter is upon us) set of streets and the flash mode make me very obvious to oncoming cars.Super lightweight, and built to last. I have been using them for months without an issue. They even work well with rechargeable batteries.One caution: Rechargeable batteries + LED's mean that when the power drops below the minimum the LEDs need, you will find that the light just stops working, unlike a bulb which dies slowly, this can cut off entirely. But keep a good charge and you won't be disappointed.","22":"These seem solid and good quality. However after using for one camping trip (right out of the box) the power button\/mode selector on the flashlight has developed a short. It is indecisive on whether or not it will turn on at all when clicked, and the half click to change modes guarantees it shuts off and you're hard pressed to get it to turn back on again. I should have been thorough about putting these through the paces during the return window before trying to rely on them.","23":"Best damn little 5 buck flashlight for EDC I like the nuts that are on the outside holding the clip on, several other types I've had used screws but screws require very small driver to tighten, these any pliers and your good to go again, the light with 1 AA gives almost as much as the NEBO Ihave that requires 3 AAAs strobe and multiple intensity beams all work very well. My only critique would be for a slightly less stiff clip it definitely stays on but requires an assist to clip on, or take out of pocket","24":"These mini LED flashlights are perfect for my little ones to use while we are out camping. They are heavy duty yet light and water resistant so they can withstand the rain (it always rains while camping). With these you have the ability to focus and adjust the intensity of light. There are 3 different modes: high beam, low beam and flashing and it only takes one AA battery. My son loves the handy built-in clip; he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him. Only flaw to me is that the clip is quite stiff so it can be difficult trying to clip it on but it definitely stays in place. Overall, these are great, sturdy little lights for the money. You get alot of light from such a small flashlight.","25":"Opened the box, grabbed one of the flashlights, twisted the top off, placed the battery.  Seemed to work pretty good.  Then, I grabbed the other flashlight, twisted the... twisted the stuck top, pull the top, WD40 the top, twist the top while holding the body with pliers, threw in trash.  The top was welded on and stripped so badly there was nothing I could do to open it and place the battery.  If you're going to seal it shut, at least provide the battery.  Ridiculous.","26":"Very light weight small penlight ,  I use this as a backup  in search and rescue operations , For the  Tuscola County CERT team. The belt clip works well on my Mollie vest . You get  a lot better light if you use a  14500 Li-on battery . The  Ii-on  batteries with the  protection circuits are longer .  If You use it with the  Nitecore protected  battery  it does  fit .  However the o ring on the cap doesn't seal because the cap doesn't tighten all the way in. I put a thicker  o ring on the cap and it works  perfectly.  If You use a standard  AA  battery it  works well, just not as bright.  It has 3 modes , High, Low, and Strobe .  This light is not a blinding power house , But for its size, weight, and price it is Fantastic.","27":"I bought these  flashlights to keep in the glove box of both cars to use in case of an emergency.  They both failed only after using them several times.  The product is garbage and i threw both of them away.  Not even worth the hassle of packaging them back up to send back.  You get what you pay for I guess.","28":"It is a small and cheap LED flashlight, I actually bought several to keep everywhere in the car, office, and home just in case I need a flashlight. It is not 300 lumens, more like 100 lumens the most.The battery life is adequate. The battery I put in 3 years still works (bought in 2012), I guess that means it doesn't just drain the power when not in use.It is solid aluminum body and does have water proof o-ring. I did not submerge the flashlight, only used it in the rain and it seems to be fine, no electric shock experienced.The ones I received have 3 modes: high, low and burst. HOWEVER, a simple shake of the flashlight changes the mode. For the price, I guess I should not be expecting a shock absorbing button or some sort, still annoying though.You can change the focus of the flashlight but move the lens forward or backward. It will change the throw from a wider area to a more square center spot. AGAIN, the lens just slides, you have to hold it to keep the focus at what you like.For the price, it is not bad, it turn on and stays on. As far as stay in the same mode and focus goes, you probably need to pay more for other flash light... If you want a flashlight that your life can depend on, then pay more to get a Nitecore, Fenix, Olight or even a Surefire.","29":"At first I was going to give it 1 star....Upon opening my package, I see this tiny box. No way that's 1 flashlight, let alone 2. I open the tiny box and see 2 tiny flashlights. Great, I got ripped off. I put in a battery to try one out just for the hell of it. Was I wrong.....these tiny things are sweet. They pack as much light power as a bigger flashlight I have, which looks similar. These are great for BOB or EDC equipment. I might even buy a couple more.","30":"Delighted with this 6-pack of small, VERY bright flashlights.Only minor quibble is that it's unclear when pressing the \"On\" button will turn on a solid light, versus turning on a rapidly-flashing light.(Apparently the flashing light - which may or may not come on - is to confuse all those terrible criminals that are trying to attack you ... 'cause, you know, you're so likely to face that \"tactical\" situation.)Other quibblette is that it'd be nice to be able to remove the pocket-clip (but it's attached with 2 unusual screws). On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be \"desirable\".  So, at least the pocket-clip keeps the otherwise completely round flashlight from rolling when layed-down.All in all, I LIKE 'em - a LOT!  :-)","31":"Considering how little it costs for two of them, they are well built and very bright.  The issue is with the switch logic.  There is a single switch that turns it on\/off (hard press) and changes the mode (half press).  The problem is that each time you turn it on, it switches to the next mode.  So if you are using it in \u201chigh\u201d and turn it off, you will get \u201cstrobe\u201d next time.  Not a deal breaker, but annoying.Again, great buy to throw in a drawer, but look elsewhere for something to carry every day.","32":"Great little flashlights for camping\/hiking.  I kept one in my backpack for any emergency that might arise while hiking.  And the other in the car to use at my campsites.  I used the campsite flashlight EVERY night - it's small enough to comfortable fit in your pocket and bright enough to walk the dog and\/or walk to the bathroom in near complete darkness and only had to replace the battery once.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to always rotate into strobe mode when I would turn it on - a little irritating, but not a deal breaker.","33":"only one of the two i received works correctly.  one of them does the hi and lo and strobe.  the other one shines a light only.  china...","34":"After a power outage, I decided we needed more flashlights available. The cheap 9 LED flashlights just didn't cut it and it was a lot of trouble having to insert three batteries into the flashlight cartridge. I have only tried out one Rockbird but the results were good. It isn't the most powerful flashlight around but it does the job. It puts out plenty of light and inserting one AA battery is very easy. For general use, it is a very good flashlight. My only con is that it is black and hard to find in the dark and in dark drawers. Wish I was able to get them in silver.","35":"I love this set of 2 mini but very powerful flashlights I keep 1 in my purse and 1 in the drawer of my nightstand next to my bed for an emergency if the power ever goes out during a storm.  You can pull the top part up and down to make the light wider or smaller to fit the amount of light you need.  It also has a flashing light on it as well.  You can even clip the light to your pants belt clip that is on it. The LED bright light is perfect for helping you find your keys in the dark and also when walking at night time.  I will be getting me another set so my kids can have 1 for them to keep in they backpacks.","36":"Pure crap! They end up in garbage can two days after arrival. Very low quality.","37":"Always, always need flashlights in our house and only LED ones.  The flashlight is bright, has a belt clip, fits perfectly in your hand and compact.  It has a caution mode, where the light blinks to let others know something is wrong. HOpefully no one will ever have to use that setting.  This flashlight being so compact is great for you need to look under cabinets and small spaces.  My husband used it for the lower compartment on his boat.","38":"I ordered these last week and after putting a battery in the first one thought it seemed like a good product, especially liking the small size.  I tried putting a battery in the second one and it will not close.  Apparently the grooves are stripped so it will not hold the end which secures the battery.  I tried to return and today discovered they are NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN so I have one flashlight instead of two.  I am wondering how long this one will last.","39":"I didn't expect that the mini flashlights would be as powerful as they are. They're great to keep in your toolbox, glovebox or purse. Also great to keep in a kitchen drawer for power outages, just in case.At just over 3.5\" long they emit a super strong beam of LED light. They are really solid and have a nice weight to them. Two AA batteries (not included) is all it takes to operate them both. I'm going to keep one in the car and use one for camping.Since they're water-resistant I can bring it out on the kayak for those evening paddles and I won't have to worry about the flashlight getting splashed.","40":"I purchased the LED Flashlight by Rockbirds because I wanted a flashlight I could easily put into the center console of my Jeep. This flashlight is perfect because it is small enough to fit just about anywhere that you want to put a flashlight. You could carry this in your purse, your vehicle, it even has a clip for a belt. Just remember, batteries are not included. So you will need two AA batteries. I am pleased with this purchase. :-)","41":"I ordered these because of their size. They fit nicely and discreetly into my purse and I can take it to go in case I need it.These flashlights are nice and bright, perfect for emergency situations or power outages. I don't like having huge bulky flashlights in my tiny apartment. They really take up way too much space. These are well built, strong and will last a long time. Really happy to have found these.","42":"I ordered my Rockbird led Flashlight thinking i was getting one. I am so surprised at the fact I recieved two. These by the way came so fast by prime. They didnt come with batteries so i loaded them today. Woot hoo. they are bright exactly what I aspected with LED. Nice and small fit so comfortly in my hand as a women the are about the size of my palm. I am totally keeping one of these in my kitchen and one in my SUV. Totally never know when its needed. Has a screw off top to change batteries as well as a nice sturdy clip to hold onto stuff. These Rock! Thank you again for the great Deal.","43":"I bought this flashlight for my work as an EMT on a Ambulance. It's small light weight and easy to use. I have a need for a bright light but I don't like to carry stupid huge flash lights on my belt. With the advances of CREE LEDs small flashlights are much more powerful now.Pros:Small size easily fits into my pants pocket.Nice strong clip that can secure it to most belts.Bright adjustable light that can light up the sides of a 4 story building and focus in like a spot light.Stupid bright light that can light up the darkest of EMS scenes without holding up a huge flash light.Price you cant beat it!The on and off button is set up so it wont turn on by mistake in my pocket like other flashlights I have.Cons:-It runs on one AA battery which with extended use will drain quickly so be sure to have a extra battery on hand.-The dam thing took 4 weeks to ship from China. After looking around on Amazon this same model ships from sellers in the USA but the price is a few dollars more.-The parts will unscrew if your not careful. The easy way to fix this is to make sure all the parts of the light are twisted on tightly.This flashlight is on par with the 5.11 taclight I own and my Surefire Light for a fraction of the money. I lost a 50 dollar 5.11 flashlight one night in the snow at a car accident. This flashlight is so cheap you can afford to loose it and still feel good about buying a new one.","44":"This are so bright.  I ordered 3 because they are cheap and then ordered 10 more just to have around everywhere, including cars.  I tried the upgrade to the more powerful battery but really noticed no difference in brightness.  These are plenty bright enough as is with the AA battery.Also, I did the RIT Big-Shot at high-falls in Rochester, NY (you can look it up, it's pretty cool).  Hundreds of people use flashlights at night to light up structures or landscapes to achieve a really unique nighttime photograph.  For this shot, we were about 1\/4 mile away from the falls.  I was EASILY able to light up the falls and my flashlight was very distinguishable from the plethora of other flashlights trying to do the same.  Many flashlights were unable to reach the 1\/4 mile distance, but this small one and large spotlights had no problem.I highly recommend this flashlight, but get lots because they are great to have everywhere.","45":"Wow.  Nicely made.  Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer).  Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode.  They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off\/on with the tail switch.  Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want.  Instead of \"jumping up and down, screaming and shouting\", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm.  All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.And think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1\/2 volts (yes, even cheap light \"heavy duty\" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's.  Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99?  Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.One little nit-picky thing: the \"Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night\" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the \"rings\" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets.  Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark.  My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!One more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries:EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packsmost of these are what is called \"unprotected\".  In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all.  So this is my suggestion: if the \"bulb\" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery.  That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more.  Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it.  This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights.","46":"I bought a dozen of these and gave about half of them away.  They're solid, and after about a year, are all working as new.  Since I got so many I was able to tell that some of the zooms slide smoothly and easily, others are barely movable.  Zoomed all the way in (smallest beam spread) the beam is nearly square, the same geometry as the LED chip.  That is, the LED chip is projected in detail at full zoom, as you zoom out the beam quickly becomes round.  With a new AA battery, the most tightly zoomed beam will reach over 100 feet with adequate illumination of the target in my opinion.  The word target refers only to whatever is illuminated by the beam, and isn't intended to imply that this light should or could work as a firearm accessory.The mounting clips on some use allen head screws, others use el-cheapo phillips pig iron screws.  I removed the clips from all of them because they are sort of sharp, and in the way.If they were of more consistent quality, I'd give five stars.  However as far as the switches and the illumination, they are nearly identical.  That is a good thing since the switches are solid feeling, and the illumination is even and bright.  They chew through a AA battery pretty fast.  I get about 1.5 hours from a good quality alkaline (i.e. Duracell, Energizer).  I've never had one go out, but they get pretty dim if you don't change the battery soon enough.","47":"Here are a few words: You won't believe what this thing does with its self-generated light!After one, count 'em one AA battery (who cares if it's not provided!) is slipped into this little giant and it's put all together again, the push of a rubber-protected red button (about 3\/4 the size of a man's thumb pad) on the opposite end of a case containing a convex lense and \"let their be light\" just seems an inadequate description.The SODIAL Hausbell Mini Cree LED Flashlight Torch (got enough words in there? Might be room for a couple more) shines by using an adjustable focus convex lense that delivers a nearly gradient-free light beam that when held three-feet high broadcasts a 24\" diameter, really, truly round light beam. Remember the shadows in other flashlights that seem to hit at exactly the WRONG place? This has none. Period. None.If you need a pinpoint beam, well, this does a darn decent job, too. A user can easily discern individual chunks of pine bark on a tree 50-feet away. At twice that distance the penetrating bean shines well into whatever woods may be in front of it.Already having one spot too many burnt on my retina, I'm not about to try a \"blinding\" light. But I'll bet it does. Enough, one fears, to blind an intruder or attacker. Really. But keep in mind that a youngin' lacking sense may also blind himself or another person. So keep this thing out of such hands.This thing rates \"very cool.\"","48":"This set of two flashlights are a great deal in my opinion.  I gave my husband one to use in his tow truck and one stays in the house for me. These flashlights are very bright and you can adjust the scope of the light from a large area to a precise close area. I use my flashlight in the house to check on eggs in an incubator so I pull the top of the flashlight out to narrow the scope. It is plenty bright for me to see the babies in the eggs. My husband has used his for lots of things in the tow truck. It is great for lots of jobs since it has adjustable lighting. It's also easy for him to keep on himself with the metal clip and non-slip grip.  I like that they are made with aluminium so they are lightweight and durable. So far they show no wear and tear even though we are constantly using them.","49":"FYI, to get it to switch modes, you turn it of then on again and it switches.  It goes from (1) bright --> (2) Dimmer --> (3) Flashing.The flashing is obnoxious.  I wish I could get rid of that.  I see no need for that in my life or 99% of anyone who buys this thing.  It just threatens you with a seizure as you try to quickly switch it off and on to a different mode.But the light is fairly bright.  No big complaints with how it works when it's just on and working.","50":"Very bright, well made, I like that it only uses one battery.  Small enough to fit in my pocket.  I use it for dog walks at night.  It lights up the ground very well and has a decent light projection for being so some.  It was a very good buy.","51":"Totally worth the price. Much brighter than the LED flashlights you buy at the checkout counter for the same price and this needs just 1aa battery rather than 3aaa like the checkout counter models.  These are tiny -FYI.  They fit in your palm so don't expect something bigger.  Great little lights.  I bought 2 just to check them out. Now I'll order the six pack and stash them all over.Just ordered 4 more. They arrived and work great.","52":"I wasn't able to open one of them to insert a battery.  Very poor design with the battery portal being combined with a light adjustment feature at the top.  It just turns and turns as though the battery portal is stripped. What a piece a crap!! It was a waste of time trying to open it and an even bigger waste of money!! In addition, the strobe function should work off an exterior switch that can be activated when the light is on. Not when you turn it off and then turn it back on only to have a useless strobe function activated.  That requires you to turn off the light again and turn it back on just to activate its normal function.  One agitated customer!","53":"So I was hoping for a durable metal flashlight that had better than average candle power. What I got was essentially a $3 flashlight with a metal casing.First impressions were it was alittle lighter than I imagined.The light was not even that bright. I dug out a $1.99 Harbor Freight LED flashlight and compared the 2 on my basement wall. The H Freight one out shined the Rockbird one easily. Not terrible enough to junk or return, a small metal casing flashlight could come in handy.But when I need a bright light, I wont be reaching for this","54":"The light has three modes, all of which are activated by the same pushbutton on\/off switch.  A half push of the button switches modes while a full push turns the light on or off.  The first mode is full brightness, then half brightness, then full brightness but strobe\/blinking mode.  The beam of the light can be focused with a telescopic feature at the head of the light where the bulb is (instead of the typical twist to focus the beam of light).  This method of focusing the light is actually much better for my frequent uses because it is very quick and easy to change how focused I need the light to be (with just two fingers instead of two hands).This flashlight can easily be operated while wearing thick winter gloves.  In the instances when you'll need both hands, this flashlight is just small enough so that you could use your teeth (its heavy so you'll have to bite hard but don't forget metal is tougher than your teeth... unless you WANT to file your teeth down)The light output isn't as bright as some other flashlights in the same price range but this is actually a good thing because I will get much more time out of the battery.  I don't like carrying extra batteries but you'll need to do that with the brighter flashlights because one AA can only give you 2-4hours but this flashlight lets me go about 6+hours before I notice a significant dimmer light.  Costco sells a duracell brand flashlight (pack of 3) for a similar price but that light is even bulkier, heavier, and uses way more batteries.The flashlight is tough enough to be dropped and will fit in your jeans pocket uncomfortably  There are much lighter or brighter flashlights but this is a great value for its price and durability.  I use and carry this everyday so yes, I would continue to highly recommend this flashlight.","55":"I am very happy I purchased the Rockbirds LED Flashlights.  They are the perfect size for your purse, pocket, fanny pack or to store in the door of your car.  They are easy to use and very bright. They come in a pack of two. I put one in my Jeep and the other in my husbands truck.  I have used mine every time I have come home at night and needed to light my way to the door.  I highly recommend these flashlights.","56":"I bought these for my son and his friend to take camping on a school trip. They came in really handy because they got caught in the rain while hiking at night and these worked the entire time (almost one hour) until they got back to their campsite. They are small enough to fit in his jacket pocket so he was the only one to have one with him beside the counselor. We have them in a drawer in our kitchen in case the building loses power and it does all summer so they will come in handy. They are very bright and I would not expect that from such a small flashlight.","57":"I'm really glad I got these.  I keep one in the kitchen (for finding equipment in all the dark corners of cabinets) and one next to the attic door (I'm afraid I use the attic as kind of an extended storage closet).  They're very bright and I particularly like the ability to broaden or narrow the beam.  They're generally all-around handy for those of us with poor vision who need an extra boost of light at times.  They're also great for finding a pet that's hiding from you because it doesn't want it's medicine.","58":"it is a bright,durable and cheap little light perfect for camping and the like.  i even used as an ice hammer when i forgot to close the lid on my ice chest and the top layer froze solid.  still works btw","59":"Don't buy these little flashlights. When I got them one of the button on the back of the flashlight doesn't work and this product did not allow returns.","60":"They don't work.  I bought them for a trip and they don't work.  What a waste of money","61":"Got both light and was excited about them (from the description) one would not hold batteries because the threads were stripped. The other would not zoom\/focus light the description stated it could \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Very disappointing to say the least","62":"Previously purchased what looks like same item thru Amazon 3rd parties (one each) on Oct 17th from vendors Warm-Mart shop and Lucky Electronics. While they \"look IDENTICAL\" on the outside, the shipment I just received from this vendor was MUCH BRIGHTER and has 3 modes (Bright, Dim, and Flashing). Other reviews mention disappointment in brightness. It is NOT a quality consistency problem, as I ordered 30 and they ALL FUNCTIONED PERFECTLY. As other reviewers warn, there are apparently different versions of what looks to be the same product. I got lucky on this shipment.","63":"It's a very good flashlight and I couldn't be happier with it. The older reviews are odd. People claiming that this is a knock-off of an \"Ultrafire\" that has a stamp on the side. I believe that the sellers have changed since then and will continue to change. You can't guarantee where you are getting your flashlight from unless it is shipped and fulfilled from Amazon. The version I got had an adjustable beam with no company names on the side and was extremely bright just with a standard Duracell battery. Turning off all of my backyard lights, the light resembled what could be a spotlight at a distance of 100ft completely lighting up a pitch black forest. I'm curious to order 14500 batteries and see how much brighter it can go.","64":"What a waste of money! These things looked like they'd be great, and I liked the adjustability of the beam angle. But they both stopped working within 1 week of being used. I've had lower quality cheaper crap from the dollar store last longer than these! I only rated them 1 star because there isnt an option for ZERO stars or even negative stars!","65":"The switch button on the end operates easily, but not so easily as to come on when, say, searching for my keys and being dead the next day.I like the single AA battery.I like the compact size. It's bright for its size-and this goes to the one thing I disliked: one photo shows this lite brightly illuminating both sides of a sidewalk. This doesn't quite do that. That overstatement is what gets this 4 stars instead of 5 from me. I got over that quickly. Ounce for ounce, this unit pulls its weight.","66":"We were looking for a decent flashlight for outdoor use - primary in the back yard to spot the pets or other critters.  I took a shot at these since they were on sale. They arrived and we kinda laughed thinking they wouldn't do the job.We were wrong.  Our back yard goes back 80 feet or so.  This thing lights it up in spot mode or the more open mode.  It's great.  I'll be picking up a couple more.","67":"These came in handy during Hurricane Irma. We live in Orlando, we lost power around midnight. These got us through that night. We eventually had to leave our home, No power for 7 days.But these little suckers were Very illuminating, Good on batteries, small but mighty. I bought one for each of my kids. It kept them entertained as the storm passed over us. We were able to play board games & cards games all night with these as our light.","68":"This little flashlight is pretty great in my opinion. The picture on the product page....well, that person obviously has a very small hand, but the flashlight is still pretty tiny. It's about three inches from tip to tip. It takes one AA battery. I dont really use the adjustable focus, but a feature I really appreciate is the flashing light setting, achieved by half depressing the button. This is eminently useful when walking across the street when it's dark and there are cars around. A driver cant help but notice you. As far as the actual light output, it is very, very bright. I use this when I leave for work to walk down the stairs and out the driveway. It is obviously also very handy around the house. The only knock on this at all in my opinion is the belt clip. You will need to loosen the bolts, which honestly kind of defeats the purpose. Without doing so, you'll never get it open enough to clip onto anything.Anyway, for the $8 or so this currently runs at, I dont feel like you're gonna find something better.One final note....it's very stout, and you could use it as a weapon in a pinch. The end is set up like a tactical flashlight with rough ridged edges and solid metal.","69":"This set of two flashlights is a great deal. I bought these so I would have one for my purse and an extra around the house. They are super small and compact but brighter than most flashlights. Small and only takes up about as much room as some lip glosses.I love that it only takes one AA to function. These flashlights are great to keep around.","70":"Pros:Great construction. A solid, substantial flashlight, yet it's light, being aluminum.LED, so great with batteries. Regular AA is plenty bright for 90% of the things you would use this for. The Dim setting is good for me when I'm out in the woods camping\/partying, and I just turn it on dim and hang it off my belt. It lights the ground around me nicely. Can be used for 50% of the things you would need a flashlight for. The Strobe setting is useless to me.The button is a click on\/click off, not a momentary-on, which I prefer. Button seems solid, and it has a feature where you click it on, then if you press lightly, there's a secondary momentary switch that cycles between bright\/dim\/strobe.The biggest problem I have with this flashlight is that that little momentary switch is activated every time you click the main switch. So instead ofClick on->Bright->Click off->Click on->Bright->Click off...You getClick on->Bright->Click off->Click on->Dim->Click off->Click on->Strobe->Click off->Click on->Bright.Annoying. I'll probably take the button apart to see if I can disable that momentary switch.","71":"This is a small iron flashlight, it is very convenient to carry, the quality is also very good, the light is very bright, the lamp head part can also adjust the length of the light, and it is two equipment, cheap and affordable, I like it!","72":"These are much brighter than I thought they would be. Its a must if you live in back in the woods. They will be used for alot more than taking the pups out at night. I really like that you can pin point the light as well. Makes for trying to seeing certain things much better. What is great about this is I get one and my husband gets one. Great purchase.","73":"I liked these so well that I gave them out as stocking stuffers to out family. They're built well, look nice, are plenty bright and small enough to have on hand or carry wherever you go. If you need a great little, durable flashlight, you can't go wrong with these. Highly recommended for sportsman and women of all activities, kids and folks in general looking for a small, bright, portable flashlight.","74":"The flashlights were defective when received.  One could not be opened to insert a battery.  Cheap and unreliable.","75":"I got the 4 pack camping lights the other day.I love them much as they are lightweight and practical.The lights are strong and have zoom in and out.3 light modes: strong,SOS,weak.and it has a clip that is sweet.and the price is so reasonable.We need more than 1 flashlight and buying 4 pack is saving some dollars.thanks!","76":"I absolutely LOVE these mini flashlights. They illuminate so much more than one might expect from a device this size and fit cozily in your pocket, in a desk organizer, etc. You never know when you're going to need to light up under your bed, behind a large appliance or the sidewalk out to your garbage cans early in the morning. The monetary trade off is ridiculous with regards to what you get for your hard earned cash. They rest comfortably in the palm of your hand with intuitive motions to light up. Only thing I can't for the life of me figure out is why there's a strobe setting,  but that's just me maybe needing a clue as to a real world application. That said, I am in no way affiliated with this company nor do I foresee any financial compensation for a glowing review. I would have been stoked receiving just one of these flashlights but getting two? i say see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!","77":"I'd gotten these previously and it was time to get a few more.I was happy with the initial batch but while they're intelligently designed, the quality of the last batch I got wasn't great. 2 of the 4 didn't function properly. Though I will say the price is pretty exceptional.","78":"For the money - these are very good little flashlights.  Slightly bulky to carry in a pants pocket.  Easy to carry in a purse, pack, coat pocket, or car.  I use these with the mini butterball 14500 batteries.  The total cost for the flashlights, batteries, and charger is about $20 for two.  I like the strobe mode for use as an emergency signal.  My only \"beef\" with the flashlight industry in general is the black color.  Seriously?  The point of a flashlight is to improve visibility in the darkness.  Try finding a jet black flashlight during a power outage!  Flashlights should be neon yellow or orange.  I don't care what they look like.  I want something I can easily find and use.  Please stop making black colored flashlights or provide options.","79":"This is not a paid review. I can honestly say this is the best flashlight for the money. Yes there are brighter, better, and costlier flashlights than this, but it's value\/durability\/ability is off the charts.True story: 10 mins before I started writing this review, my girlfriend and I hear this terrible noise coming from our dryer. Yeah, that was my flashlight... It went through a complete full load, heavy setting, hot\/cold wash cycle and then hit the dryer for a quick jaunt.It's a good light.","80":"This is a small compact flashlight with a bright light, I have found it to be handy for lots of little things and big ones like flipping the fuse box. The only downside is I hate the strobe light because it hurts my eyes and you have to see the strobe in order to turn the flashlight off. The other downside is the flashlight has a lot of blue.","81":"These guys are perfect. I love their little size. And even though small they provide so much light. I love that I can spotlight or shine a large area. I am very satisfied and would order another one of these packs anytime!","82":"Super bright little flashlights. The focus on them is fun, but usually not very necessary. They seem like they can handle a pretty good beating. I carry one on my belt at work as it is compact, lightweight, and it comes in really handy. The only complaint I have is I wish the belt clip was heavier; I snagged it on my bench the other day while I was working and bent it all up. I took off the clip (held on by two small allen screws) and applied some love with a pair of pliers and it works great again. I don't know if anyone else would have this problem and it's easy to fix, so it's not worth taking off a star. I may make a heavier clip for it myself though.Overall, they do what I expect them to do.","83":"Better than I was expecting for the price and super bright for how tiny they are. If you put a good AA battery in them you will be stoked. I like that the light can focus in on small spaces. Good for exploring tight spaces. I would imagine they would be good in the mechanic industry. I mostly bought them for walking at night so people dont run me over. And for going into tunnels and sewage drains to look for clowns and stuff.","84":"They are quite bright and seem to be solidly constructed, but the picture made them seem a bit larger than they really are. They can only hold one AA battery, so if you're expecting the larger kind with the caddy that holds three AAA batteries, you will be a bit disappointed. That said, even as small as they are, the price is very good.","85":"Great little flashlights! When we got them, we put the AA batteries in ( 1 per light) and they worked perfectly! When you click the button the light come on bright, click it again, and it's a different brightness, click it a 3rd time, and it strobes! They even have a little clip on it for a belt or a backpack! When you turn the front edge if it, the \"circle\" of light gets larger and smaller... this will be perfect for camping!!","86":"The preformance and quality of these little flashlights is amazing.  I haven't used one long enough to expend the single AA cell but the amount of light they put out from 1.5 volts defies belief.  The color temperature is higher (bluer) than I would like for longer duration use, their small size makes up for that in convenience and their billet aluminum housing is as rugged as more expensive competitors","87":"They aren't bad lights, Really bright, lightly depress the switch and release to change the operating mode, I Just happened to get one with a bad switch, It pops loudly, occasionally doesn't work or won't turn off. The other flashlight is fine. Oh, the fluorescent lines? Those are silicone\/rubber bands that glow in the dark.","88":"Great little flashlights.","89":"I received this light couple days ago. I was actually amazed how bright it is. Blindingly so. Focuses from beam to spot. I'm using it with a 2000 mAh NiMH AA battery. It seems to be made of pretty resilient materials. The strobe mode was an added plus not mentioned in the specs. I plan to use the light as a backup signal device for night walk. I was so impressed, I just ordered 2 more for my family. Highly recommends!!!!","90":"This is not a 300 lumen light. It is dimmer than my Fenix which is about 115 lumens. Don't buy this unless you know what you're getting.By the way, since the light supports both 1.2V NiMH batteries and 3.7V Li-ion batteries, I was hoping that there was an internal regulator. Well, there certainly is, but it isn't very effective. I used two batteries: a 2600 mAh 1.2V AA and a 900 mAh 3.7V 14500. If you do the math, you find that those batteries can deliver about equal power. But, the AA battery makes the light significantly dimmer. That means that the regulator isn't doing its job - if the flashlight was truly designed for both battery types, the regulator would drive the LED at the same voltage regardless of battery type. What happened here is probably that the light was designed for a Li-ion 14500 and someone noticed that it happens to work with an AA as well. The quality is NOT the same, and if there really is a CREE LED in here, it isn't being driven to its full potential.","91":"These were purchased as gifts.  Both recipients are very happy with the lights.  These are being used as Every Day Carry (EDC) tools.  These have been in daily carry\/use for three months with no complaints.  Very bright, work great, good battery life and a variable beam at a great price....what is not to like?Remember...it is not a Streamlight, SureFire, Fenix, etc....but it works, and it's 5$.  Worth every penny!","92":"These are extremely tiny, they fit in the palm of my tiny lady hands but they are powerful and work great....I just want people to know because the picture can be deceiving.  I would still recommend these as I use them alot.","93":"One of the four flashlights doesn't work.  The others are fine, but disappointing to have one be defective.  Actually,a second one has stopped working.  I am going to see if I can contact the seller.","94":"Excellent deal for a pair of probably most efficient flashlights ever invented.","95":"Nice sized, bright flashlights. They have 3 settings - bright, dim and strobe, and you can adjust the lens so it either floods or is very narrow. You really can't beat them for the price, and the form factor is great for throwing one in a drawer, one in your truck, etc.Also running on only 1 AA battery is nice! Battery is not included though.","96":"So far these seem like good solid lights I would compare them to the \"csi\" nebo lights the only thing I would like better is if you could make then only bright mode and not have to cycle the switch 3 times through dim and strobe to get to bright again","97":"Price is too good to be true. Don\u2019t expect them to last. One of mine just died and the other only flashes?!?! It\u2019s been 2 months so I can\u2019t return. Not happy! Good luck!","98":"I bought these in lightening deal not entirely realizing the compact size (my husband is a flashlight fanatic). Wow, was I ever excited to open these up and realizing they fit into my dog walking bag. It's also a nice compact size to stash in my center console. Needless to say, hubby hasn't gotten one finger on these flashlights. These are mine, all mine.","99":"It was a love at first sight. Perfect pocket size, incredible design (military style), very durable (I dropped it many times and it still works), and very bright. I love the modes (full power, dimmed, and the strobe). Never seen a flashlight before with this type of adjustable focus (by \"stretching\" the flashlight), which I liked, too. It's been working on a single AA battery flawlessly for 3 months now (I use it for about 10 minutes a day, everyday). It's also very functional - I use it (actually two of them) for a night bicycle riding. I mounted them on the handlebar using rubber brackets (also available on Amazon for a few bucks) and it feels like I have two powerful headlights. The only minor thing that I would change about this flashlight is the mode sequence. If you are using a dimmed mode and you turn off the flashlight, and then you turn it on again, it goes to the next preset setting, which is a strobe light. I wish it stayed on dimmed. It's still my favorite flashlight, though. It beats many of my $40-$50 flashlights.I was also considering the Ultrafire 1000 Lumen Cree 501b T6 LED Flashlight Torch (similar design) for only $5 more, but they come without the batteries. I did some research and found out that a decent charger with reliable batteries cost around $50. It would be probably to big to carry it in my pocket anyway, so I'm going to stick with this perfect little thing.Even if it stops working tomorrow, I'm still going to give it five stars and order a new one. Even if it means ordering a new one every three months. Still worth every penny.","100":"little rust inside and poor quality","101":"Arrived fast and in perfect condition.  Using 2 in motorhome for camping and 2 for home.  Tried one out at it has a very bright light for its size.  Am going to love carrying a smaller, lighter flashlight around.  Has a clip to hang on belt or purse.  Thanks for a great product.","102":"The power button on mine protrudes a little too far out of the end, making it hard for the flash to stand on its own on the floor\/desk. I own a couple of similar looking flashlights that don't have this problem. I don't know who made that produding button, SODIAL brand or the seller HFHF INC.Other than that, the flash works fine.  It uses the same Cree LED and aluminum shell as all of the other brands.  The flash is very bright initially, but loses much of the luminance after about half an hour of usage.  After about an hour, it gets really warm to the touch, and the light is barely visible.  If I let it run all the way, then the flash would blink, indicating that the battery is out. Note that I use rechargeable NIMH AA battery.","103":"I needed two mini flashlights to keeps by my kids' bedside ... these work perfectly.  They are the right brightness for using when you need to get up out of bed in a dark room -- not blinding, but fully illuminates what you shine it on.  Actually brightened the whole room.  Not blinding when kids shine it at each other, like they like to do!  Great product for the price.","104":"These flashlights are AWESOME!!! They are very compact and do the job they need to do. They are great for around the house. Keep one in the car in case you break down. They have that neat flashing feature to warn other motorists. Take one with you while you are out walking or while you are out with your pets. The little pocket clip is a bonus. I think for the money and the size, this is the best flashlight I've ever bought.","105":"These flashlights are so valuable and they are very easy to carry, also they are very bright, i think i spent 10 dollars very worthy that hard to find another place!","106":"These flashlights are the most recent addition to my emergency\/camping equipment. They are super bright and only require one battery. You can use them as a spotlight or wide light which is convenient. I love how light weight they are and they have a clip that allows you to keep them on your belt, hat, or backpack and in easy reach. I will be purchasing more!","107":"This didn't work at all when I got them and they didn't refund me the price I paid\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude10","108":"Bought these little Led flashlights for my grandsons. I don't know why but all my grandkids love flashlights I can't ever have too many.This is the type of flashlight that they can just slip into their pocket without feeling bulky and heavy.Great product for the price. Only downside is that I didn't think they were very bright, but the boys love them.","109":"These RockBirds 7W LED Mini Tactical flashlights are not that bright (but many LEDs flashlights are really too bright for most uses). They use a lens to give a highly focused beam, which isn't very good for just walking around. I like that they don't need special batteries, just AAs","110":"Bright as can be. Best survival kit addition. You should buy two of these sets. One for your back pack, one for you car, one for your apartment, and one for your travel bag. Seriously a great flashlight to carry along with you, everywhere. Very bright, focused and wide light adjustments, and durable!Buy buy buy! Ok Bye","111":"Was really excited for these lights. Poor quality the on\/off button on one is failing it doesn't turn on and the others internals aren't holding together where it should slide to zoom very disappointed in this product.","112":"These little flashlights outshine some of the bigger flashlights I've taken with me on camping trips.  I also really like the strobe feature, if I ever became lost in the woods, this would come in handy for flagging down assistance.  The flashlight also has a clip on it, which makes it very convenient for attaching to my waist or my backpack.","113":"These give amazing light and are very sturdy. A bit heavy for a compact light, but the clip makes it easy to carry. I ordered them for our hurricane supply kit after Irma hit us. We've used them several times and were so pleased that I got them  for my brother too.","114":"I used this type of flashlights before (they are rather generic), and these also perform as well or better than many brand name units. One thing to make sure is to tighten the clip screws using thread locker, as those screws tend to get loose over time and my get lost rendering the clip useless.","115":"Definitely a fan of these flashlights, they are small but very bright. Really good quality and the clip on them is perfect for outdoor activities when not in use. The perfect size to keep in a convenient place, I put one in my glove compartment and another in my first aid kit. Definitely recommend these as you get an excellent product for the price.","116":"Really cool little flashlights. These are fairly small and light but they are also very sturdy. They do not feel cheap or weak in any way. Really nice quality, well made. I like that they are small, makes them super portable. I also like the adjustable focus feature, could come in handy. I definitely like these and can surely recommend this product.","117":"I used these flashlights at night when I take my dog out. They are very bright and work great. They are so small they fit in your pocket! I actually keep one on the leash at night. You can tell it's made of great quality! I can't believe 2 were only $10, it's an amazing value. You need these if you go outside in the dark at all!","118":"These little flash lights are so useful! I love the fact they are small enough to fit in my handbag, glove box or clip on my pocket. I was not expecting the light to be so bright, they are actually brighter than a bigger much more expensive flashlight my husband keeps in the garage. I will be purchasing a second set to keep in our camper!","119":"So the one I could open to put a battery works ok, but the other one doesn't unscrew so its useless.  Not a great deal.update (5 minutes later) After taking the battery out and trying to reassemble the one that worked, the housing which holds the lens over the LED came off, so 100% garbage.  stay away.","120":"Great little flashlights that put out Great light. I recently started with a volunteer Fire Department and was looking for tools to fill my pockets with. Flashlights are one of those key tools. This little flashlight is simple to use and even with it being so small and with wearing gloves, it is easy to turn on and off. Definitely worth the buy.","121":"These are sturdy little flashlights that we plan to use in our kayaks in case we need a light. They are a lot sturdier than I would have thought for the price, and they have the flashing lights that would be of use if we find ourselves stranded out at night.","122":"Don't be fooled by the size of these flashlights. They might be mini, but they give off so much light. These two flashlights are so convenient and handy. The fact that they are small, they can fit anywhere (glove department, purse, pocket- there's even a clip that you can attach to your pocket). Will be a great addition to a survival kit.","123":"Great little flashlight. At first glancethey look so little you wonder how much light they give. These little things give you just as much light as a full size flashlight but with the clip they fit anywhere!","124":"These are good to have everywhere, especially like the clips on side so handy. Great when walking dog after dark, in car, bedside, to hold somewhere while hands busy repairing anything. Not tremendously bright but worth owning. Great  stocking stuffers. Affordable.","125":"Nice small and handy flashlights.  I kept one myself (always in my pocket), gave one to my wife and one to my grown-up son, and am keeping one in my car. Will be handy during very likely upcoming (now as the temperature has hit 100F) power outage and soon approaching Fall season's power outages.","126":"I bought this light for less than a Lincoln. It came from China [and it definitely took its time, probably went the scenic route] and I was pleasantly surprised when I finally came after a couple of months.But it's worth the wait. It's bright and the beam is highly adjustable. from a nice wide with a relatively sharp falloff to a narrow beam in which you can see the actual LED cell [looks sorta like a battery meter]. It's body also very well built and feels way too robust for the few piddly dollars it cost me. Looks and feels like it milled from a block of aluminum.The clip is super tight and the pull mechanism for focusing the beam does feel a touch flimsy, but I'm just nitpicking at this point. Excellent light, this is.","127":"For $3.50 including shipping, what do you expect?  It is bright, but not dimmable.  It can be focused, but there is no way to hold the focus so it just slides around.  I wrapped rubber bands around mine.  Great x-mas stocking stuffer.Oh, its bright, but not 300 lumens.  Its a single AA battery after all.Update:  I read a few more reviews and there was a lot of talk about being able to dim these lights by a half press on the button like most flashlights.I tried it on the 2 that I have and they definitely do not dim.  Maybe the latest batch do?  Once again, its cheap and bright, but dont expect too many features from a $3.50 flashlight.","128":"The low price is the only reason I am giving this flashlight a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating. This is not bright at all even on the \"high\" setting. The metal finish on the ones I received is spotty and not finished. Not impressed at all.","129":"I got one a couple of weeks ago and used it a couple times. Seems solid. Listed as 300 lumens, and you better believe it. That's about as bright as the D cell Mag lights, and I have one, and it is about as bright. The adjustable beam is great, I can set it and change one handed, and BOY the spot really reaches out there and the wide beam covers a huge area up close!It says waterproof but I haven't had the chance to test that feature yet.It seems rock solid, and with 3 functions, bright, dim, and strobe. I could not be MORE pleased with any small flashlight at any price. This thing really seems to fit the bill, and I see many more of them in my future. I want one within reach all over my house.","130":"I wasn't expecting much out of these and bought them as a quick fix for a camping trip, but I ended up loving them and I'll use them for more than camping! It's great that they only take one AA battery and the light is still quite bright. The clip  is handy, and they feel much more durable than I was expecting.","131":"Overall it is well built for the price however the max output is probably not even 150 lumens. To call this 300 lumens is such false advertisement. It is bright enough to do the job and AA batteries are easy to find and they are cheap enough to loose or keep around.","132":"These lights have a nice, solid feel to them.  I like'em. I have not used them much so I can't comment on the operational quality.  All too often, cheap flashlights tend to start having problems with the on\/off buttons or you have to smack them to get the light to turn on.  We'll see how these hold up.","133":"So far, these are working great.  I've had them for a few months and they've been on a few camping trips.  I like this size flashlight because they are easy to give to the kids and have them put them in their pockets.  Big flashlights get set down, and forgotten.","134":"great value for the money and brighter beam than expected. Nice telescoping feature that allows you to adjust the light beam width\/brightness","135":"It\u2019s tiny cute flashlight.  As of luminous flux , this little flashlight generates amazing light intensity that can be light up a spot 50 yards, even 100 yards away. There are two light modes, the continuous one and the twinkling one.","136":"Great lights!  Extremely bright.  The cost makes these quite the bargain.  I placed one in each of my cars.  I plan on buying more to put in my squad car for an emergency, and to carry while I am on duty.  By far the brightest light I have ever owned for the size.","137":"I own several smaller Cree LED flashlights and I'm very impressed by the performance for the size. This is a step up from the smaller lights and puts out some serious light. Brightest flashlight I've ever owned. Zoom feature is great!","138":"Complete junk.  Worked for like a day","139":"Flashlights are ok better than I expected can't really beat 2 flashlights for the price only had for a few days but so far so good.2nd review haven't had the flash lights longs and starting to not work thought was good first 2 weeks then work half the time","140":"I am really pleased with this product. They are lightweight and compact. They'll easily fit in my purse or even a pocket. The quality is great too,  they're really bright and easy to operate. All in all, I'm very happy with them. They also arrived quickly and were packaged securely. I'd absolutely order again.","141":"This light is just as good as a 70 lumen Coleman that I got for twenty bux on closeout from wallyworld mart.  The Coleman is bigger and uses 3 AAA cells instead of one AA, and focuses the beam with a rotating collar instead of a push-pull sliding one.  The Coleman's light is rather bluish and the light from this Sodial is much more pleasant.  The only thing about it that doesn't beat the Coleman is the size of the lighted area at the widest beam setting.  The Sodial is smaller, lighter, just as bright, a bit easier to adjust the beam, has a clip and is a quarter of the price.  And it has bright, dim and flashing settings which you switch by pushing the button halfway.Overall - - Excellent.","142":"I liked these. I didn't realize two came in the package so I was pleasantly surprised. They are extremely bright (which my toddler loves, she uses them to shine on the ceiling during the day). And they only require one AA battery, which is better than some since I don't always have larger batteries on hand.","143":"These lights are bright. I bought two of them and they are quite bright for only running on a single AA battery. I know that if you purchase a more expensive type of battery that is the same size as a AA (I can't recall the name) that this will supposedly be brighter, but I have 20+ AAs lying around so that is what I used. The build quality feels pretty good, the only part that concerns me is the on\/off button that feels a little cheap, and will probably be the first part that breaks. Probably about twice as bright (as well as a more defined beam) as one of the 8 LED 3xAAA lights you can get in the checkout aisle of Ace. More compact as well in terms of diameter. For ~5 bucks, these are quite nice. I plan on putting one in each vehicle to use in case of emergency, etc.","144":"For the price and quality of materials it appears to be a winner.  I have purchased 6 of these so far and all are functioning and work great.  Three modes of operation (high, low, and strobe) functions by tapping the rear button.  The ability to focus beam is really nice.  I have seen this same light re-branded for 4-5X more at various tacticool sites but this is same unit.  Only funny aspect of this light is when you get the focal length just right you can actually see the LED die and junction projected on the wall.  The delivery of this was before stated time but still it takes like 3 weeks to come from Hong Kong.  I think I was quoted 2 months on delivery but it came well before stated time.","145":"small in size, good quality, bright enough. The reason I purchased this is because the hook that coming with it. Before this, I lost many of the flashlight. Love the hooks, no need to worry that I gonna lost it again.","146":"Only out of the box, no prolonged use. Its bright enought for an inmediate area search light but won't light up a room. For the price you pay for two, rates 4 stars. If it holds up longer than 2 months it'll be a five star item.","147":"They are okay, but not very bright if only using regular batteries.  Don't get these unless you want to invest in the extra powerful battery\/charger.  This doesn't put out nearly the light that the duracell 350 puts out with 4 aaa batteries(I use rechargables)","148":"This small flashlight puts all my other ones to shame.  I used a regular AA battery, but will get a brighter lithium battery later.  I bought five and didn't get enough. It's hard to believe the high quality for the rather small price.  My husband gave it kudos, too.  Friends and family will get one of these as a Christmas stocking gift.  So, I'll need a few more soon.It took a minute to find the opening for the battery on the top.  It's a small item, so it's easy to overlook.The flashlight is shipped from Hong Kong, if you want one, plan on as long as two weeks to receive them.  Mine took about a week and a half.","149":"These flash lights are small but they put off so much light. I bought these for my family and I to take to the beach and use them to go crab hunting. I am very happy with how well these lights have worked.Great quality and compact which makes it easier to take anywhere or carry in purse.","150":"Incredible product for 9.99. I have rechargeable batteries and bought these because of hurricane Irma but the power save mode is much appreciated. It is very bright and the ability to focus the light if you need too is very helpful too. They are a little small (pocket sized) but they are quite strong. Like I said, incredible product for 9.99 ($5 each flashlight)","151":"You get way more than you pay for (at least as far as the pricey world of flashlights go) with this light. If there are any flaws it is in the switch, which isn't able to turned on without clicking it all the way on. Some other lights can be turned on with a half-press of the switch, but not this one. The click of the switch is also relatively loud, which makes it a poor fit for stealthy needs. But at it's price and size, it's a perfect light to stick in a everyday carry backpack or in a car or something along that line. I wouldn't recommend it for survival, law enforcement, or any other critical task but for everything else it's perfect.","152":"Bought these to keep on us during hurricane Irma. They worked well and I loved the clip. Made it a bit harder to lose track of.","153":"One of the two works fine, the other one does not work at all. It doesn't click, it seems all empty inside the orange ball, where it is supposed to click on and off. Cheap stuff, not worth to send back.","154":"So far I am incredibly impressed.  For the prize, size, and battery source this light is truly incredible.  I can honestly say this light is just as good or better than my old 3D Mag Light (not the newer models).  With it only needing one aa battery this is truly an awesome addition to a bag or truck.  I have had some lithium battery powered lights this same size that are on par with this light.  I might be returning in a few weeks down grading this to a one after it dies without cause, but tonight I am truly impressed.","155":"Powerful little handheld flashlights and extremely useful to have! They come in handy and I have them in several rooms, my car and tucked away where I would need them inthe dark. Easy to carry, they are unobtrusive so make it very easy to stash them.","156":"Super cheap. These are kind of our tiny emergency flashlights so I wasn't expecting a big sturdy flashlight. These are barely bigger than chapstick and are not that easy to put batteries in. They work but I wouldn't buy again.","157":"Bright, well built, handy little flashlights.  Easy to carry in one's pocket.  Like that they only need a single AA battery.","158":"I really like these little flashlights. They are perfect for keeping in your purse. They also can easily hook onto your waistband. This is what I carry for convenience and safety since they are such a compact size. Gave one to my teenage daughter too. The price is great for two","159":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this low cost flashlight but it is fantastic.  It uses a single AA battery which I use a rechargeable for so I can just use the same one over and over without buying more.  It has 3 modes, solid bright, solid dim and quick flashing.  The crenelated end cap is great for self defense if needed.  It is light weight and compact.  I will probably buy a bunch of these now that I know how great they are.  The lens on the end is also easily removed and can be used as an emergency solar fire starter if needed of if you have some steel wool you can use the battery to start a fire as well.  Multiple uses in something is always a good thing!","160":"I got this 2-pack for $8 shipped, so I guess there's little to complain about. I bought them for the cars since the small size doesn't require a space premium. Surprisingly bright for a single AA battery. I'm curious to try them with 14500 batteries to see how they perform. For the price, it can't be beat. They are solid and perform well. Definitely recommendable if on sale.","161":"Very bright flashlight. I like the LED glow vs the regular lens. Item come packed well in a box. Very good quality. Metal casing that can stand up to wear and tear. I plan on using these lights for emergency and also when we go camping. It is nice that there is a place to put a clip or lanyard.","162":"Oh man...I got this to put on a mount on my 12 guage shotgun for home defense.  But it's so light and yet so durable and it's got a great orange power button (orange is my favorite color!) that it's hard to put it down.  In fact, I like it so much I ordered three more (two more for me to use in my car and in the house) and also another one for my brother who is a flashlight snob like me.  This has got to be one of the best investments of all time.  The shine from this is both intense and large so it really lights up an area clearly and lights up a fairly big circumference for area\/space.Go get one!  You'll know how awesome this little bugger is!","163":"Tell you the truth... i bought them for my mother in law who was always complaining about not having flashlight when ahe loses power in the house and ahe bothered me to borrow mine. Now since I got her these flashlights she doesnt even use them and keep bugging me for flashlights... guess what i took flashlights back for myself and borrow her the ones i bought her... great , small and so bright... ask my mother in law!!","164":"Pretty darn good for the price. Clip is stout. No batteries included, but it's a single AAA, and puts out enough light to see well. Had to figure out which end to unscrew as the machining was in good tolerances. That was fun. Glad there were two. For the price, can't beat it.","165":"I got this on sale for under $5 dollars and it feels and works like its worth every penny so far. Beam is strong and easily adjustable via the sliding (no turning) head\/lens. Over time I will see if this wears out and starts to become an issue by moving freely or being to loose. Outside is all medal construction and feels durable. Modes are on, low, and pulse\/flicker. Orange rubber switch with light touch\/push to change modes. Even at the current price if you need a small flashlight with 200 to 300 lumen output this appears to be a good choice. If you order dont be in a rush for it. Shipping is long because its coming from china or somewhere in asia.","166":"Have it for 6 months now, at least it's still working. I leave it in the garage so that it comes in handy whenever I need to find something in the garage. I use regular AA battery and works just fine. I have since replaces the battery 3 times, which is expected and acceptable. I have no compliant for its function, but for the price that I paid (~$10) I think there are other sites\/places that occasionally sale more powerful and function units for the same price or less.I have since brought 2 more 900lm units and 1 more 500lm headlamp unit from other place and loving them. The two 900lm units use Lithium-ion rechargeable battery that makes me more comfortable to leave them in my car to make sure I will have the power when I need it. I recommend potential buyer chose their product base on their intended usage or you will end up with whole punch of junks in your house. I rate it 2 star since it's still working but the price\/value point isn't as I expected.","167":"These are great little lights, small, cheap, and bright.  What more can I ask for... ?  Well, I could ask for a switch that always comes on in bright mode instead of the next mode from when you used it last, very annoying,  But overall, a handy little light to drop in your pocket.","168":"These are great for work. Get the upgraded batteries","169":"All of them are working great. Bought some from another company in colors, and a few had problems, so they are not prefect, but for the price, amazing even if one out of 10 does not work.Seem to use up batteries a bit faster, but with only one battery at a time, seems to be OK or on par with other flashlights on battery use.Have 10 now, all over house, use them all the time, fantastic.","170":"Nice, bright little flashlight for the money. I bought a couple to have on hand for power outages and I think these will be just what I need (although I have larger, camping lantern style lights if I need to light a bigger area).","171":"I loved these Rockbird flashlights. I already have these flashlights for over a year, and they still work wonderfully. I lived in Florida and they came in handy when we got hit with hurricane Irma.","172":"One worked fine but the other heated up to an unsafe temperature, hot enough we removed the battery and disposed of it. If we had left it much longer it could have been seriously bad news.","173":"Pretty bright for a small AA light. Works well and is a good light to keep in your backpack or in your car. Put a drop of oil on the battery cap screw in and the main lamp adjustment and it will work like a $25+ light. It has good o-ring sealing in the rear battery compartment.Although not listed, both of my lights came with a fast strobe mode (happens when I depress and hold the on button to turn it on). That was a pleasant surprise but I'm not sure if all of them have it.If you are looking for a good and reliable light, look no further. Buy 2 since it takes about 2 weeks to get here and you'll want more than one since it's so handy and useful.","174":"Very happy with my purchase! They are tiny metalmagic flashlights as they illuminate so much light!!!Perfect feeling in your hand and great for kids as well! Three modes: bright light, refular light and strobing ligh.","175":"GREAt, compact flashlight. Nice quality","176":"I love these flashlights! They are super bright, you can adjust the beam, and it even has a clip so you can put it anywhere. Very well made. I feel like I can throw it into a wall and it would still work.","177":"I keep this tool grasped in my fist when walking through dark parking lots in downtown Atlanta and feel much safer.Even during the day the beam from this light will temporary blind you.  The edge on the front is enough to hurt someone if used correctly.For those of you who actually use it as a flash light, it is nice for that too.  The front telescopes in and out to adjust the focus of the beam, and the clip works good for belt or vest (I also wore this on my vest in Afghanistan).As I'm writing this review I am buy 2 more, one for each vehicle.","178":"Got these two flashlights on sale and well worth the price. Like the small compact size with a lot of light emanating from the bulbs. Great feature of bright, less bright, and a flasher. One is next to the bed, the other in the car for those emergencies. Also, like the ability to focus the beam when necessary. This is the kind of thing that you don't need until you get it. Highly recommend.","179":"For the price I paid I expected to be no so tough, but they have lasted so far, and the light they provide is very bright, my only complain one of them had a defective switch, but was an easy task to tear it apart and fix it.","180":"Great light use it for work. Super bright and you can adjust if you want the beam to be narrow and bright or have it cover more ground but not as bright. I've used one for a couple hours and still have not needed to replace the battery so that's super nice.","181":"it's not the lumens it says it is, I am not sure if I like the zoom in and out option to make the light broad or pinpoint, on the extreme pinpoint setting, you can actually the reflection of the LED bulb ... but for the price, I am not complaining, pretty darn bright and solid metal design along with compact size ... great for emergency spots like car, tool box, fishing, hunting, power outage, camping, etc... do not use this for tactical \/ law enforcement or military... I guess you could but I would not trust it to work in all conditions such as those, it's made in china...","182":"1st of all, I have some higher end CREE flashlights. They take the 18650 batteries. Although I do like this flashlight for the price, I was duped into buying more 18650 batteries for it and found out that it takes 14500 or AA batteries instead. The 'Frequently Bought Together' section showed 18650 batteries as though they were for this item. I bought up to 6 more batteries because I purchased 5 of these flashlights on 2 purchases. Now...I have to buy the 14500 batteries and find some use for the 18650's. I believe this is an AMAZON screw up, not the vender's. JUST BEWARE!!When I received the 1st batch, there was only 1 of the 2 that I purchased in the package. I am waiting for a follow-up now. Will finish review later.","183":"Holy crap... My girlfriend worked for Surefire for a brief period and was able to get a deal on a flashlight, after first use... thought it was bad arse and super bright. After seeing these things for $5 I couldn't help but jump on it. Plopped in a AA battery once we received and looked at it while turning it on like a smart guy... instantly blinded! These things are awesome because you can zoom the light beam... I'm pretty sure if someone breaks in, I'll just shine this and tell em I have a gun pointed at em and they won't have any idea... Going to be buying these and put them all over my house... Also looking for a 1000+ lumen one as well.","184":"First and foremost this is not a Surefire or a Streamlight, or even a Fenix, what it is, is a functional, solid, compact and economical light.I bought this on a whim, and I must say I am thrilled. It is small enough to fit compactly in your hand and use as a strike enhancer in a self defense situation if need be. (For those who are untrained or inexperienced in proper punching techniques, squeezing an object like this, or a roll of quarters, dimes, lighter, etc... can assist in preventing weak\/limp-wristed strikes\/punches) When held in such a manner the switch can be activated with your thumb, and the semi pointed tip can be used with some effectiveness when delivering hammer punches.The adjustable focus on my unit came in handy from adjusting to a spot to a floodlight as needed. I gave one to each of my kids so they can walk the dog at night, and if someone by chance still chooses to harass them while walking our 100 Lb. Doberman, they have a flashlight that may assist them if a self defense situation should arise.","185":"These little things pack a punch! They let out tons of light despite the small size.","186":"Love the size, husband and I just got back from a camping trip to the beach. At night we used the flashlights for sand crabs. Also perfect fit in the small pocket of my beach bag. Also has a belt clip, my husband wore his. Bright light and has a blinking setting.","187":"I bought 4 of these, one for me and some as gifts for friends. The order took a long time, but after contacting the vendor, another order was sent. I expected it to take a long time and I was not in a hurry.They were worth the wait. Bright. Plus they adjust by sliding the lens in or out. The most focused adjustment has an odd square shape, but I think it's cool that way. Also, they're sturdy with a nice clip for a belt or pocket. I like them so much, I decided to keep two for myself. Might even get more.","188":"My husband works in the oilfield so I grabbed this two pack for him and his friend to use while at work. They are simple, only take 1 battery, and they really liked the brightness of the light and the fact that it has a tight clip on it so it stays in their pocket well.","189":"Really great flashlights, very bright, well made, for an excellent price.","190":"This is exactly as described. Takes single AA, focus beam, and on\/off switch.But if you want selectable click with dim and flash you need to get this one: \"CREE Q5 3W Led 350 Lumens mini Flashlight Zoomable Torch AA\". This version has the three different modes when clicking. Though it didn't have a memory of the previous mode and doesn't do temp on when partial pressed.Sorry, back to this version... It is a very nice light for the money and even though the shipping time from China is a couple weeks it is still a great light.","191":"Fantastic flashlight for the price.  Note, these ship from China and take a few weeks to arrive.  Several companies make these lights but they all look the same.  I'd ordered others in the past that had additional functionality (clicking the on\/off button included, strobe as well as low power setting) that the recent ones don't.That said they are bright, use a standard AA battery and are focas-able.  They have a nice aluminum body with plenty of grip.  I bought 4 to leave anywhere I might need a light (car, shed, closet, etc).","192":"These are tiny, but mighty. I can keep one in my pocket when needed. The light is very bright and illuminates well.","193":"Great product for the price!  Arrived as stated. Good packaging. Would recommend","194":"It's created from metal not plastic, and it's a good quality, it has only one mode not three modes (unless if there is a secret way to run it) pressed the button many times but it give only one mode. you can change the zoom of light or the focus of it by moving the above part up or down which gives you different zoom and focus of the light.It give a nice light even when try it with a used AA regular battery ( not the chargeable kind ).For home use or car check or outdoor for close area, it's really a nice choice for it's price. 300lm or 200lm or whatever it says, the bright of this light is far enough to let you see in the dark. and for it's price, it's a must to be in your car\/home.Note: About the seller, this product arrived to an international address even before 6 days from the last day of the estimate time for the shipment. and they ship it protected well with protection foam and included in a protect bag.Addition: I would like to add that the one mode that this flashlight has, is a good feature, as sometimes it's annoying when you want to turn on\/off the flashlight and you have to go through all the modes. so I found it having one mode as a good feature for me ( I already have another head flashlight with different modes, it's nice, but need to press the button 3 times to turn it off) this one is not and i start to like it this way.","195":"Okay the pluses are its lightweight, small, takes a regular battery, the button is easy to push and is bright. The drawbacks are that the focus moves easy so when you deploy it it's usually set on wide angle so it's no good for tactics, the clip is turned the wrong way to attach to my ballcap for hands free operation. The bevel end for striking is marginal.If you want a tacticool light to blast the eyes of a thug with lightening speed this aint it. If you want a good light for a bag, hunting pack, glovebox that allows you focus ability it's not a regrettable choice by any means.","196":"update. both flashlights have ceased working after less than a month. so the verdict is; do not buy this product.fantastic little flashlight!! very bright and love the zoom feature.  I use it to walk dogs in the dark and it is perfect.","197":"These are great handy little flashlights. I put one in my car and after using it my husband said he is taking my other one for his truck. I really love that you can adjust the light to sort of \"zoom in\" on something specific with the light.","198":"Well made, solid aluminum.  Was tough to figure out how to unscrew it to put batteries in.  Its the little cap on the end where the push button on switch is.","199":"These are decent lights to keep around the house or in the car. They aren\u2019t super high quality, one of mine the rubber cover over the on\/off switch was installed wrong and it makes it hard to operate the light. I don\u2019t think they are really 300 lumens either. I have a 300 lumen light that I compared it to and these are a lot dimmer. Good cheap flashlight.","200":"I got this on sale and was rather skeptical about how well it would perform on an ordinary alkaline penlight battery. Well, I'm happy to say that it was brighter than expected and absolutely outshines any of the inexpensive, single-battery LED flashlights I've purchased over the last few years. It also is much brighter than the 8 or 9-LED models that use three AAA batteries. The light has a bit of a bluish tint, but not annoyingly so, by any means. With the adjustable lens fully forward, this baby will project a small, rectangular beam of light for over a hundred feet. Bring the lens back and it becomes a nice flood light. As others have mentioned, the lens just slides back and forth rather than staying in a secured position as it would if it were threaded. However, you'll likely not be using it much as a spotlight, anyway, due to the narrow beam.There apparently are several types out there that look virtually identical and what I was expecting was the single on\/off variety. What I actually received was the one that gives full brightness, off, reduced brightness, off, strobe and off for each push of the tail switch. Although this is an ordinary locking, click-on\/click-off switch, there apparently is some circuitry that keeps track of the number of times the contacts open and close in a short period of time. In ordinary use, the light will always come on at full brightness and go off with the next push, just like a regular flashlight. I also tested it with a battery that was getting weak and, although dimmer, it still produced plenty of lightAt 3.2 oz (with battery), this is heavier than I expected and is also fatter than other 1-AA lights. It appears to be quite rugged and that also goes for the clip, which is fastened by two screws. Not sure I'd want to carry this in a pocket for long periods of time--maybe on a belt, though. It was wrapped in ample bubble wrap inside the envelope in which it was delivered, which held no paperwork.","201":"I typically do not write reviews, but I was impressed when I put in a AA battery. Very small flashlight, but super bright. I did not notice a big difference in brightness between the spray view and the focused view, but there could be a difference in distance (just guessing). My purpose for these was to be prepared during power outages and to maybe use while camping.  I am buying some more soon. I could see these as a nice gift.","202":"Because they were $4 each that got them one star. Because they worked they got another. Because they did not work properly two stars is all they are worth.","203":"For the price these are very nice and worth it. They easily compete with my more expensive Fenix flashlights. I can't speak to battery life yet though. I am definitely happy so far with them. I will update this review if they break down or die quickly.","204":"This is one of the must haves for each and every family. We used it for night time outdoor exploration, under closet repair and kids love it for haunted house.","205":"I purchased some larger flashlights recently but needed something that was easier to carry daily. I love the size and the build quality. Plus just one AA battery is nice. They are nice and bright and have a cool zoom feature.","206":"Hurricane survivor, power outage, flood, fuel, food...not the F word I was thinking...I was thinking ... FEMAI have C and D size maglights, a bunch of cheapo LEDs (bulbs looks like x-mas lights), a $100 surefire, craftsman rechargable worklight and a dewalt rechargeable.This is the flashlight that I am ordering again.  Ergo this review. In terms of cost and convenience, nothing beats this light.  For general lighting, like walking around, going to the bathroom or scooping out floodwater, just point it at the ceiling, its that bright.  The battery lasts really long.  I didnt time it, but I was using some cheapo \"philips\" zinc-carbon batteries (ok really really cheapos) and only needed 3 over 12 days.  I agree its not 300 lumens but when you are in pitch black, its plenty.At 10 feet, it throws a remarkably even 6 foot circle of light.  None of my flashlights can do this. The button and button cover is flimsy, so what, I got duct tape. The lens is plastic so expect it to get scratched over time. I paid over $30 for my maglights but the cells were close to dead. But everyones got AA size. Worst case, grab some from remote controls.As an aside, get youself a little a portable radio, it saved my sanity...And a good sleeping bag.  My -15C walmart special kept me plenty warm.","207":"Arrived on time and product is as depicted.  Great mini flashlights for the price.  Bought these for my husband who uses them at work.  Would definitely buy again","208":"These small LED flashlights are wonderful!  Small enough to carry inconspicuously, yet still extremely bright when needed!!","209":"Wow what an awesome and bright little flashlight! The construction is quite sturdy, the pocket clip is secure but not too tight for me, and I love the adjustable zoom. The small size is also really handy. I have only tried this with alkaline AA batteries, but with those it is very bright. I will try lithium and Ni-Cad batteries once I get the chance. I actually purchased two of these and ended up buying a picatinny mount for one and mounting it on a shotgun for a cheap but effective weapon light.Overall, this is a fantastic product, especially for the low price.","210":"Just like other reviews say, there is 3 settings.  High, Low, and Strobe.  You can't just use one, so you will have to push the button to go through the three settings.  I have one set on high so when I go outside, and I have one set on the strobe that is locked up in the lockbox next to the pistol.","211":"These are super handy and bright!  They fit in my pocket but can spot a coyote from a far  these are going to be my lifeline out here in the country this year!  So glad I purchased these and intend to order another set for my daughter.","212":"Great light, very bright for the price.  Don't really care for the strobe mode, and you have to cycle through it to get back to the brightest mode.  But what can you expect for such a cheap price.","213":"Bought two of these...liked them enough to order four more. Recently opened a two pack of the second ones I ordered. Good light overall not great. Disappointed to find out one flashlight doesn't work out of the box brand new. Would've given five stars based on the value. Not an extremely bright light but better than average considering price. They also burn through AAA batteries quickly. Can't get past only getting half of what I paid for...that kills the value part that compensated for the average brightness.","214":"They are small and light, easy to use. The best thing I like is it only need one battery, not three.","215":"Sees like a good light so for, it is pretty handy due to its small size if you carry a light with you, the design fo beam adjustment is not my favorite, but based on its size it puts out a good amount of light, the price is very good as well and I have had this light for quite a while now and it has continued to be  very good, I have used several times.  it is not my main light but purchased to carry with me because it is so compact and I have used it enough now to gain confidence that it is dependable.","216":"Make sure you get the right batteries (not the frequently purchased ones shown on sales page), you need the lithium 14500 batteries (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0035H9A1K\/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3)  that are more AA battery sized not the larger ones. Other than that the focus is done by sliding the lens cap end forward and back, it does a decent job lighting up an area and spot focus shows the shape of the LED inside at close range. For the price I can see one being tossed in each vehicle with a cigarette lighter plug charger. Just remember not to place your LI-ON batteries in a regular NiCad or NiMH charger as it could cause it to explode.","217":"Arrived very quickly and seem to be a good product. I admit they were smaller than I expected, but that worked out okay because they're a good size to carry in  a pocket.","218":"Great little light; good beam quality; heavy duty case.","219":"BRIGHT! (and small)","220":"This was advertised as 300 lumens and it just doesn't seem possible as it is much closer to other lights I have in the 100 lumen range.  This is a good light however so I'm really only deducting 2 stars because the stated output seems inflated.The focus mechanism is useful but not particularly good at holding a focus setting - it's somewhat loose and just a slide mechanism.  I like the fact that it feels sturdy, only needs 1 AA, has a an anti-roll design and can be stood up on it's tail so that the light is aimed upwards (e.g. at the ceiling).  The cutouts on the head also allow you to place it lens down and you'll be able to easily recognize if you accidentally left it on as light will bleed through.","221":"These are compact size flashlights, fit in palm.  3 light levels with click of button at the end of flash light. It is good for daily use to keep in the pocket for emergencies or just for walking the dog at night. Recommended","222":"I bought a bunch of these to keep around the house in case of a power outage. They are very bright lights and the focusing is nice to have but I very rarely use. The multiple modes are nice too but again I barely use those. The light is very small and portable so it's easy to clip it or prop it up somewhere while you work. I've had one of them I've been using the past few months while doing house work and haven't needed to change a battery yet. I recommend these to people I know if they are looking for lights.","223":"This flashlight is super bright. I can have my bathroom light off, which is in the middle of the house so very dark, and this light will light the whole room up. you can see just like the light was on. This light is amazing!","224":"So bright it can be used as a weapon","225":"Took a while to get to my door, however it worth the wait. Solid product, bright light, adjustable focus. Feels good in the hand. Use only one AA battery.UPDATE: Changing review to 3 stars. Beware of different sellers selling this product. I bought the first one from Harmons  and it was a great product as described above. Later, ordered a second one from tech360cc and it was nothing like a first one, feels \"cheap\" doesn't have dim and strobe functionality, clip is loose.","226":"This is a great mini flashlights! The size is small and fits so comfortable in my hand or put in my pocket. Also they are so bright than i expect. Very reasonable price for two, five stars!","227":"I like this pack of flashlight so much!! It comes 4 pieces in one package. Also it is very convenient to carry, you can also clip on your pocket!! The light is bright! I will consider buying another set.","228":"I received this light yesterday. It took about 3 weeks to arrive from Hong Kong. I was actually amazed how bright it is. Blindingly so. Focuses from beam to spot.  I'm using it with a 2000 mAh NiMH AA battery. It seems to be made of pretty resilient materials (machined aluminum). The strobe mode was an added plus not mentioned in the specs. I plan to use the light as a backup signal device for night kayaking. Haven't tested water resistance yet but the threads are O-ring sealed. I was so impressed, I just ordered 3 more. For the price, why not?","229":"Worked well and were priced well.  The lights are bright, they include a strobe light and a wide to narrow beam focus and a belt clip.  They are made well from sturdy metal with no plastic parts.","230":"These are great flashlights. They are perfect for any outdoor activity - hunting, fishing, walking your dog and picking up poop... They are heavy duty so they can be packed in your gear and will stand up to the rugged outdoors.","231":"Superb quality, extremely bright flashlight at an astoundingly low price. You will NOT be disappointed. I have them all over the house and in every car...ended up buying 8 of them.","232":"These are great little lights and put out a big adjustable magnified beam. They last about 3 years before switch or other problems develop but worth every bit of the money paid.","233":"Nice bright compact light for the price.  The focused beam is an odd square shape, but not an issue for me.  Have been using for about 3 months and seem to be good quality.  Will buy more.","234":"This is probably the best and most compact set of flashlights I've ever owned! I don't like candles so they are perfect for power outages and I'm always losing things so the ultra brightness is very effective for that too!","235":"Great buy. Good price and they have three modes. Low high and sos.  They also come with zoom that will allow more light and will put up a nice square when you pull the front on the flash light forward.","236":"These are my favorite! Very bright, compact, and zoomable. Plus they come in 2 pack. One for the car, and one for home. These are awesome for their price.","237":"Awesome lights!","238":"Bought before hurricane Irma. Wanted led flashlights.  Small enough to fit in pocket.  They were exactly what we needed , as our power was off several days.Don't overlook this pair of mini flashlights. They do the job.","239":"Great item to have. They are so compact that you can carry one in your purse, bag, or car, and not worry about it taking up much room at all. Easy on\/off button for someone with arthritis, or a young child.","240":"Love the size of these flashlights. Makes them easy to carry with you until you need it. Nice that they come in a pair. Can put one in my purse and one in the car. Very bright for the size it is.","241":"these are the bigest bang for youe buck. very very bright. i was looking for something to keep in my vehicle that wasnt big but was still bright  wnought ro get the job down and this is the PERFECT flash light for that!I have no relation to the seller, this is my honest opinion. :)","242":"I was about to give it two stars since I was so sad that I lost one but then I realized that was silly. These are so bright and small! Great for camping or anything. Solid construction. Batteries haven't died. I'll buy more of these if I need more flashlights.","243":"These flashlights are awesome. They are very small but provide a super-bright light. I especially like the 3 settings: bright, dim and flash. The flash is almost like a strobe light and is perfect for walking the dog at night. The clip is great too. Highly recommend.","244":"I ordered these to put in our camper for a light that didn't require a lot of room.  These are perfect and give off light  exactly what as  I wanted.  I would buy them again.","245":"I like it and my daughter too. We will use them for camping next week!! \u26fa\ufe0f","246":"very bright and portable.  will use in the car as a light for maps, task lighting, or, emergencies.  great for entering a dark movie theater.  would love to try out other products from this supplier.","247":"Perfect little flashlight. Feels very durable and rugged. Has three settings: bright, less bright, and strobe. Runs on a single battery, so it's cheap and easy to use.","248":"Awesome value for the price!! Well build and powerful enough - the lenses are a smart way of defusing the light - it works well.","249":"Very small flashlights but they work well. I would have given a full 5 stars but one of them wanted to be annoying and not work 100% of the time. The light exposure was great, it gave a lot of bright light. They only take 1 AA battery which is great. I purchased a 24 pack of AA's with these flashlights- both were a good purchase.","250":"Ultra-convenient and compact flashlight and a group of two, super easy to carry, do not have to fear the dark place","251":"I love them!! OMG they look so cool and are so bright!!! I was checking the tires a few days ago and suddenly the whole \"neighborhood\" went visible! lol..Awesome design and I love how durable they are!I'll definitely recommend to my everyone I know..","252":"I like flashlights, and for the price, I was skeptical that I'd get anywhere close to 300 lumens from a $5 light. I tried using a single AA battery and it was pretty bright - I'm guessing around 100 lumens based on a comparison with a Fenix light.The build quality feels good - it feels well machined and not exactly like the $5 flashlights I'm used to seeing at brick and mortar stores. For the price, you can afford to buy a few of these and keep them all over and not feel bad if one gets lost or stolen.","253":"they are a great deal.  they are not high end, but for the price, they throw a lot of light with 1 battery.  Put them in all of the cars.","254":"I've used plenty of cheap LED's, mostly those with 7 or 15 or a million of those crummy LED \"bulbs.\" This little wonder blows them all out of the water, and adds three great features the others don't have: 1) It's incredibly bright, easily besting all the regular flashlights I have, 2) It has a high power\/Low Power\/Strobe option, and 3) It has a focusing feature which actually works quite effectively. The price is beyond right for this gem, and you shouldn't think twice about ordering it.","255":"This mini flashlight may be inexpensive, but it is junk. Uses 1 AA battery so not nearly as bright as the same LED powered by 3 AA batteries (see the \"Lighting Ever\" zoom flashlight with the same CREE LED). The adjustable zoom is not at all smooth, requires using your other hand to pull on the collar. The lens is low quality, creates non-uniform lighting with a bright ring outside a dark band. Pay a few more dollars and buy an excellent alternative. I bought 1 of these just to compare to the Lighting Ever zoom model (bought 2 of those, and love it). Also takes forever to receive this junk, shipped from China.","256":"This flashlight deal is a steal! This light put out a strong beam for its size and its very durable. I am a locksmith and this has become my everyday flashlight. It works great and the magnification is such a helpful thing. I would highly highly recommend this product because the brightness, durability and the cost. Get you one and i promise you will not regret it!","257":"Rock solid construction with great beams of light. Only use 1 AA size battery. It fits comfortably in my jeans pocket and compliments my EDC. Not to mention that the price is extremely reasonable.What's not to like? :))","258":"Wow these were a lot brighter than I expected. I bought one to attach to my home defense shotgun and the other for my car. The only draw back was not being able to get the belt clip off without snapping it but no biggie.","259":"It is small but mighty. This little flashlight is very bright. It also is light so I can carry in my pocket, purse, or on my belt loop.","260":"Use it on my gun belt clipped to my magazine holder.  Watch out for the little screws, one fell out but I think I can find a replacement.  The light is tiny but very powerful.  My favorite light so far. I have two now and will probably order more.  one AA and thats it.  Dropped it numberous times on concrete and still works.  What a rip off from other tactical lights.  Its been field tested and more officers are interested, you can buy a few of these for the price of a standard \"tactical\" duty flashlight.  Strongly recommended, takes a while for item to be shipped.","261":"really cheaply made and flimsy.  The light is bright and there's a flimsy lense you can move to adjust the beam... not bad all in all but not great... you get what you pay for.","262":"I have bought ~40 of these and give them away to family and friends.  Tactical tip and super solid.  They are good for a female(or male) to have in their hand when they are walking at night.  Adjustable beam and sometimes have variable strobe\/etc.  I am a bit of a flashlight nerd and have some $100 flashlights but these are just amazing in that they take one AA bulb and give out a lot of light for the money!","263":"For the money, this is a great light. One thing I didn't know until recently was that the light is adjustable by pulling and pushing. Before I knew this I would turn the front of the light and nothing would happen so I just thought it was broken. It has a very wide option but also an incredibly focused, narrow light option. It is actually somewhat fascinating how narrow this light is able to be when you want it to be.I would recommend this and\/or buy again.","264":"This flashlight is like having  your own personal automobile headlight. set to high beam. Very bright flashlight and barely the size of you pinky finger, incredible!!","265":"I use the flashlight with a 14500 battery. The flashlight works well - however one of the 2 flashlights has failed - I guess you get what you pay for","266":"These are hard to beat. I think I have about a dozen of these now. I have them in almost every room of the house somewhere and in all my toolboxes and glove boxes. I have no idea if they are 300 lumens or not, but they are plenty bight for every day (night?)use. They outshine my brand name 110 lumen flashlight and for certain are brighter than my old school Mag Light although they are not as good of a club. Plus they run on cheap batteries and have a fairly decent battery life. They have high, low, and strobe modes just push the power button within a second or two of tuning on. I really have no use for now for the other modes, but I guess they are there if I need them. They certainly beat the 10 for $20 led flashlights you find at the big box stores. One note, they do take quite some time to arrive, but all of mine have showed up eventually!","267":"I picked these up for a song during one of the Amazon deals.  They are outstanding little flashlights, plenty bright.  I'd recommend the 14500 Li rechargeable batteries at 3.7V if you want the intensity to go up about 3x.","268":"Bought these to put in my hurricane preparedness kit. They are ok. They feel solid, and the brightness is fine. However, when I put in the battery and tightened the cap the light came on and stayed on despite depressing the button. I loosened the cap a bit and it worked properly, but it seems like a design flaw. Not the best flashlight I've purchased, but I got two for $9.00, so for the price they are ok.","269":"Of the two, one worked perfectly, the other would only switch on in dim mode, and needed to be switched to bright mode. They are build solidly and the working one does a good job. Amazon customer service is perfect as always and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. I would try them again,  my guess is I just got a bad one.","270":"Decent set of heavy flashlights. I like that they use standard batteries as opposed to rechargeable ones. These lights are bright and get the job done. Good set for the price","271":"Great for the car.  Inexpensive.  Cheap on batteries.  Small and can be put anywhere.  A lot of light for a single AA battery.","272":"It works as described. Does the job for me. Kids use it all the time and they're still intact. Batteries last decent amount of time so worth the money","273":"These things seriously have range...great flashlight and size makes them convenient. Wicked bargain would buy again!","274":"Excellent flashlight.  Puts out a lot of light from a compact, durable body, uses only a single AA battery.","275":"I really liked these...so did the repairmen in my home as they walked away with the two I owned!  Great gift for a man apparently!","276":"Poor quality.  I thought these would be pretty decent, like the J5 tactical flashlights, but they are not.  The reflector and insides of one has already come apart and is not easily repairable.","277":"I ordered these because it's hurricane season here in Hawaii. They came just in time, and they look and feel pretty durable. Perfect to have in the house just in case.","278":"A little bummed at how fast it's draining the battery, but it is very bright. Loving the bright and dim modes but kind of hating the strobe. I guess if you have a BYO strobe party it's cool or you have to defend yourself against a racoon, but otherwise it's another button you have to push to get to bright mode again","279":"Excellent.  Just what I needed.","280":"These are very sturdy, durable flashlights. They are also decently bright with two different light settings. Would definitely recommend.","281":"Good little well made flashlight. Can't beat them for the price. They make nice gifts.","282":"I\u2019m actually surprised the amount of lights it puts out... and the ability to change the focus is amazing... Lowell made and compact.... After receiving the flashlight, I end up ordering another pair... try it and you won\u2019t be disappointed...","283":"I like this flashlight, they are very bright and focus adjustable. Compare with MINI MAGLITE, this is very good and save more using 1 AA battery compare with the other brands. I recommend it.","284":"These flashlights are awesome. They are small and able to be carried easily.  They give a lot of light and we got them just in time to use for a power outage which was perfect!","285":"Not as bright as the Solaray one I have. These always want to start out flashing so I have to remember to push button twice.","286":"I already had a bunch of LED flashlights I had picked up here and there, but all of them were a little too fat for my gun mount. Not wanted to spend $130 on a tac light my friend recommended, I decided that this one was cheap enough for me to not care if it didn't work.The flashlight is insane. Only a notch or two down from my buddy's $130 Zebra Light, and it was $3-$5. Could not be happier with it.Customer service seemed distant, but when they realized that I hadn't received the first one they sent, they jumped right on it and offered me a refund or a replacement product. I got my flashlight in the mail 6 days later.","287":"It's compact, lightweight, focusable, and bright - exactly what I was looking for.","288":"OMG;  who would buy regular flashlights anymore?  LED is the new bright light.... These LED Flashlights are so amazing an they last FOREVER!","289":"These work even when repeatedly submerged under water about 12\" deep.  Good for dealing with emergencies, floods, surf fishing...","290":"Nice sized little flashlight! They are really bright and compact. Perfect for pocket sized emergencies and for keeping in your purse for extra reassurance.","291":"Small flashlights with okay light.  Not something I'd use except maybe to find my way to the bathroom in the middle of the night","292":"Works great. Husband and Dad liked the flash lights and size is easy to take with you anywhere. Will buy again","293":"I love this torch!!  It took 2.5 wk to get here from Hong Kong, but is worth the wait. It has a bezel that you can move in or out, to adjust the beam. On the 'wide' setting, it produces a very evenly lit circular spot. When used in the dark, the 'beam' setting will easily light up something that's 50+ feet away. The 'beam' setting looks strange though as it produces a squarish spot, but it is BRIGHT.","294":"Surprisingly small flashlights, but work great and are very bright. Like the option to focus or in focus  (spread the beam) the light.","295":"These flashlights are amazing I have one in my car for emergencies and I have another one to use when I walk my dog. The lighting is great for long distance As well as short.","296":"Nice bright light. And it's cool that you can widen or narrow the beam, depending on the situation. Very happy with them.","297":"one was broken (button turns on, selects through modes, won't turn off) but the other is just fine.","298":"Tiny cheap flashlights that are very bright. I haven't tried freezing them in a block of ice or running over them with a Humvee but there's still time.","299":"Really good low cost flash lights. I got them last minute for a camping trip and they worked amazing.","300":"Got the 2-pack for 8$. Absolutely wonderful for that price. Reasonably bright and the focus adjusts really well too.For this price, I wouldn't think it twice.","301":"This flash light is very nice. It has an option of a dimmed light, flashing light, and also a bright and long extended light. I like it a lot and have used it  lot.","302":"The 1st flashlight I used at work fell apart in my pocket.The barrel that focuses the light  stripped out the inner threads.I will try the 2nd light this week.","303":"Nice little flashlight. Bright output with AA battery. Zoom feature is a big plus. I almost never buy a non-zoomable flashlight after I first bought my zoomable flashlight 5 years ago.","304":"Not too bad for the price I paid.  They are bright.  The area where the battery goes is a little hard to turn, but still worked just fine.","305":"Love it. So useful when I trying to fix my pipe. Strong light with amazing size. All I can say is fantastic","306":"Although it comes from overseas fulfilled by Amazon, do understand you will be waiting over a month to get it. and when I finally received it, it was excellent, much brighter even on a standard AA battery, the lumens compared to other small flashlights i have is definitely notable. The special price I paid made it well worth while and with the Cree board it was definitely worth it. Glad I ordered 5 of them to have around the house and cars :)","307":"This flashlight fits in my palm.  It has simple push button to turn it on or off and the zooming control on a ring.  No other control options which is exactly what I needed.  It has a single LED with a powerful lens to focus the light into a beam.  the light is pretty bright even when it's powered by a regular AA battery.  You can control the zoom by pulling the ring which is about quarter of the full length of the body.","308":"They cheap, so they don't get held to super high standards. The slide to amplify light is only useful when at max power. The light gets focused into some logo I can't make out. Not good or bad, just an observation.","309":"These are great little flashlights! I bought more of them because I loved them so much! They are extremely bright and easy to carry in your pocket.","310":"My husband is obsessed with this flashlight.  One battery and it lights up like a police helicopter.  Best flashlight ever. It can zoom or be diffuse.  It's heavy and wish it had a wrist strap but otherwise awesome.","311":"These are Great, Small, and Bright flashlights. We use them often and are excellent replacements for the large bulky flashlights we carry in our cars.","312":"We needed small strong flashlights so we could see our new very dark puppy in the yard in the dark.  These are heavy, solid, bright and work perfectly.  I would recommend for purse, car, or very dark puppies at night....","313":"I wish they had come with some instructions, but one can figure it out. Bright light, great for small places, like a car or purse, and easy to tuck ito a pocket for an evening walk.","314":"The flashlights are great for the price. It fits the pocket and easy to carry around. It runs on one AA battery and bright enough for most of the tasks.","315":"they are not as bright as I thought it would be but it's still a great price for the amount of flashlights you receive","316":"Didn't realize how much I'd be using these little flashlight but I use them nightly.","317":"After seeing this $5 flashlight, I'm glad not to be in the flashlight business! Very decent quality, machined metal. The \"switch\" works well. No instructions are included, don't worry, not to difficult to figure out how to change the battery (hint:the ring directly next to orange on\/off switch(. Shipping from Hong Kong to NJ took 15 days - much less than the time estimate provided by the seller. I'm going to order a second as a backup!","318":"Work good. Batteries  last a long time. Really bright","319":"I've carried it every day in my pocket since I received it.  Use it at least once every day, super bright.  At least twice as bright as my regular 3 Cell C Maglite with a much more even light pattern.I was so please with this cheap little light that I bought a bunch more to give to family and friends.After carrying it daily for 2 months now it still works great and still on the first battery.","320":"Slow ship from Digital center. Ordered Nov 13th. 1st 4 did not function, making them useless as Christmas gifts. Finally got 4 working lights Jan 8th.With AA not 300 lumens not expected to be with AA. I am not buying a 14500 3.6v Battery for a < $5 flashlight. Second batch seems to have more consistent manufacture on the sliding bezel for the zoom function. Metal clip is very stout.  I have done worse on cheep Ebay lights, but does not make me confident as a go to in SHTF situation.More update to come possibly.","321":"Love these little lights. Super bright. The strobe light can be used as a defensive weapon. It totally can slow someone down.","322":"This light is a great size.  I'm not so sure its 150 lumen, but it is very bright.  I like how it only uses 1 AA battery.  It comes with a decent belt clip.  Adjustable beam is handy.  Out of 5 I have ordered, 2 have 3 modes, low, high, and strobe.  Some have no modes.  Some come in a box and some dont.  They are all CREE LEDs though, nice and bright. For the money this light is a great value.","323":"Lights work well and are bright. You have to cycle by pressing buttons for the three different settings. Not bad for the price.","324":"Arrived in perfect condition, on time. Each one works great. Very happy. Have them scattered around the house.","325":"Nice - in past flash lights crapped out after a few months - corroded with white stuff inside...will see how these do..","326":"These are pretty nifty flashlights! They are super bright but still nice and small. They seem to be very well made.","327":"Unable to open battery cap of flashlights. Contacted supplier, still no response. Worst Product & Service.","328":"It just arrived this morning.  After first glance and touch, I think it's well worth the cost... .  Small, but rugged and with a great design.","329":"Great bang for the buck. It provides a lot of light for a product so small.","330":"bought these on sale, they came 2 to the package.  nice quality, good light output, appear to be long lasting on the batteries.","331":"They work well, lightweight and somewhat powerful. They do the job. Good on the battery also.","332":"I bought these (2) when they were only $8  They are such a great value and only take one AA battery.","333":"Excellent product at an excellent price!  Arrived on time and was as described.","334":"A very solid purchase, this flashlight blow my mind, I wasn't expecting a lot on this very small flashlight but i guess good things comes in small packages.","335":"Small and convenient. Can never have enough flashlights in case of emergency.","336":"The flashlight is worth the few dollars as something to tuck away in the utility drawer, glove box, or garage.  The quality is what you would expect. It is generally well made, some rougher edges, and a bit of plastic shavings stuck under the lens.  I would prefer a mag light style twist focus to the friction based one they use, but you can't have it all.  Overall, buy one, you won't be disappointed.","337":"Nice bright little LED flashlights, can't beat them for the price, love the adjust-ability and the different light modes.","338":"I really like this item..Very light,and strong..Built well,and very handy around the house...I wish i could have 2 more...Thanks..Mr.Keiper!","339":"Product is a great flashlight, it's bright and the adjustable focus is cool.However, I purchased this to attach to my picantinny gun mount, and it WILL NOT fit in the standard 1'' flashlight mount.This product came up when I was shopping for gun supplies, so I assumed it would work for that purpose.The flashlight itself is fine, but don't plan on using this as a firearm attachment.","340":"No returns and that's no good","341":"These are great little flashlights. Very compact and very bright. Small enough to fit in my pocket; and they are very sturdily built. Recommended.","342":"Tiny yet powerful and the battery charge seems to last a long time.","343":"These are small and great.  I bought a bunch for small Christmas gifts.  One batch I ordered is different than the other, hence the one star deduction.  The first batch will cycle through 3 modes as you turn it on: low, high, flashing.  The second batch only has on\/off - no flashing or varied intensity.For the price, I don't really care which one I get.  I keep on clipped to the visor of our cars, just in case.","344":"When using for any amount of time these get really warm in your hand, great if you want to warm your hands in say-Alaska!","345":"I had bought a pair similar to these previously and really like the design. This brand however was cheapened considerably. I was not impressed with the switch most of all. Being not as crisp as the other brand.","346":"Great little flashlights with good power and variable light beam to fit different situations. They were very useful and efficient in a power outage during a hurricane. I ordered two more.","347":"Very small which was awesome and it was doing what I bought it for until the light stopped turning on. Flashlights seem to have a mind of there own. These would work good for around the house and emergency use but not for any type of work\/long periods of off and on usage.","348":"These lights are handheld lights and pretty bright. Easy to grip and can conveniently be stored just about anywhere. Good buy!","349":"The price for these was great.  For such a tiny item, they are very bright.  Great in case of a hurricane when candles just won't do.","350":"Not bad.  One of them doesn't turn on anymore, and not sure why.  Battery is good, and all connections seem good.  ???","351":"Bright little flashlights that feel very substantial for such a low cost.","352":"Really bright for the size one aa battery a plus","353":"I use this flashlight for work. It has awesome brightness and uses one AA battery as opposed to the expensive special batteries the tactical flashlights usually take. Works great for up close or zoom it in for distance. Definitely a good buy, especially for the price.","354":"Great price, small and very bright- Easy fit in any pocket One can't have too many flashlights","355":"The light is super Bright for its size. I am not sure how long it last on 1 set of batteries yet. I wish it had a rechargeable battery option so I gave it a 4 star.","356":"Great pair of flashlights that works great and actually have switches that works, unlike many of the cheap flashlights.","357":"these are decent lights for the price but are not 300 lumens more like 100. compared it to a 125 lumens I already have and its not even as bright","358":"They are great for reading a menu in a dark restaurant","359":"This flashlight has exceeded my expectations so far, I've had it about a month I bought them because I have a lot of AA batteries and they were cheap. I had a similar Cree with rechargeable batteries it lasted three months barely on my last deployment, this one is a month in and going strong,it's been doused in jet fuel and dropped more times then I know but still shines bright for 10 bucks and you get two can't beat it.","360":"Perfect size flashlight for my purse and one for my car.  It provides a bright light for such a small flashlight and the price was excellent.","361":"These flashlights are the BOMB! Love their size and brilliant light.  Reminds me of the flashlight seen on the tv show CSI.","362":"Very good quality lights for the size of flashlight","363":"I'm going to stick with Streamlight or Surefire. In all fairness the price comparison with this brand and the others isn't a true comparison. I think for an extra flashlight to throw in your vehicle or tool box these work well..","364":"GREAT little flashlights!  Powerful, tough, inexpensive.  Strongly recommend!","365":"Best of the best, use regular AA battery, just one battery. Similar flashlight I had in the past use 3.7v battery. Pain in the neck to get one. So I discarded. This one is the best. I am giving it as a gift to many people. Thanks for designing with common sense battery.","366":"handy.  don't know how long batteries last yet as they're still too new.  :)","367":"The output is not even close to the 300lm stated in the description.  I have numerous high end flashlights and this is probably more like 100 lumens.  I bought several of these to keep in drawers, cars, etc and some of them had what looks like plastic shavings in the lens.  Spend a few more bucks and get something better.  These aren't anything close to what the description would have you believe.","368":"Excellent pocket or purse protection.  We ordered these for the hurricane season.  Perfect.","369":"Lite lighting lasting longer liberally.","370":"These things are junk. They work for about 2 minutes and then they die. Not battery dead just dead. Don't waste your money","371":"Nice. Well made. Adjustable lens. Minimal packaging.  Batteries not included.","372":"I love these flashlights. I bought for my son who's going on a camping trip. Very compact. Has three different settings.","373":"Really bright little light with decent battery life considering single AA.  Nice alternative to charging 3 AAA batteries which many use.  When a storm is coming and you want to charge up all your flashlight batteries with a 4 battery charger, you will appreciate the single AA.  Not enough of a light output difference between this and the bigger 3 AAA type to make a difference.  It is a very good quality, good buy.","374":"works good, I used this during hurricane irma","375":"The lights are  Nice.  Several others are similar.however  promised the Xmas Delivery..  no-show- Still waiting for some type of acknowledgement.ps it kept saying out for delivery.  im rural and i froze three days waiting for the driver","376":"This was a great buy and they work well.  Good to keep in the car glove box.","377":"I donated these to people that needed them in Texas for the hurricane.  I am sure they are getting used","378":"Very good little lights. Nice and bright. Need to buy more of them.","379":"It is bright for a little flashlight. I always have it with me. I keep one in the car and one in my bag. I would buy this one again.","380":"Got it for my granddaughter camping trip. Small size which was great and very bright light.","381":"These are cheap knockoffs of a more quality product.  Not very bright.  Not worth the money.","382":"Good flashlights at a good price.","383":"Small but very bright. Bought four and keep in various places around house!","384":"Good quality construction, bright light, working with no issues, using for hiking, back packing and on the nightstand","385":"Good little lites!  A bit cheaply made, however, you can't beat the price!","386":"You'll need to buy several more.I started with one, now I own 6 and plan on buying more.VERY bright little flashlight when you use the lithium AA battery.Being able to focus the beam is helpful if you want to light up something far away.I keep one in several drawers in the house, in the camper, in both vehicles, backpacks, etc...","387":"WOW are these bright. Theyre small but they pack quite the punch. They feel nice and hefty feel like theyre powerful. 10\/10 i love em","388":"Have to press the button repeatedly to cycle through the options.","389":"THEY PUT THE OLD FLASH LITES TO SHAME. I HAVE BOUGHT MANY","390":"The build quality is great and they were very useful during Hurricane Harvey but one of the flashlight in the 2-pack was defective and is hard to get it working.","391":"Bought this for fun. Used it for about 20 minutes total time. Runs off one AA battery. Bright as hell. Beam is adjustable by extending and retracting the lens assembly. Resistance on the extension\/retraction is not great so it has a hard time holding your selected light spread.Seems pretty durably put together.I haven't really put it through its paces, but so far so good.","392":"i have to buy batteries  china junk","393":"works good.  Love that it takes 1 AA and its pretty bright for what it is.","394":"Nice flashlight, Good value","395":"came as a 2 pack one flashlight only turns on in dim mode, flash and high mode no longer work, was used on two or three times. The second one still works","396":"All six flashlights worked perfectly out of the box and allows us to have quality flashlights in multiple rooms around the house.  They are easy to use and provide sufficient light despite their small form factor.","397":"They work great and it only takes one battery but it is nothing special","398":"these babies are bright and do not really go through the batteries. Great price on this two pack.","399":"Very bright flashlight.  Used at the beach walking at night looking fir shells. Decent battery life","400":"Great product! These things are amazingly bright. I also like that you can adjust the beam from a smaller, focused beam to a wider beam.","401":"This is one bad a$$ flashlight. Blows away led lights 10 to 1. I used to like the free Harbor Freight LEd's but compared to this flashlight they are pretty useless. The zoom is super bright to about 60 feet or more. Very well constructed and fits in my front pocket. I ordered 4 extra to replace all of the other flashlights I own. The price is fantastic.","402":"This is a pair of solidly constructed, bright mini flashlights.Plan to leave one home and use the other for travel.","403":"Little cute flesh lights! Love it. Small , handy and great quality.","404":"Great bang for your buck! I have 6. There are made in china of course. It seems to me that many different Distrubuting Co's sell this exact light under different names but all are the same, cause I have 6 from 3 different Co's. My local hardware store sells this for $10. plus tax. Only negative is out of the 6 one may have a switch problem.  Keep one every place you are. Price is great.","405":"I've owned three of these flashlights to date. The first one lasted about 9 months. I used it on the job, working in mechanical and boiler rooms, and it had a couple of moderate falls (4 feet or less). It continued working after those falls, but one day I found it simply wouldn't turn on. Looking inside the battery tube, it looks as if the surface where the positive terminal of the battery is supposed to contact has been worn away. Can't say for sure what happened, but I ordered two to replace it. They are cheap enough that I'd rather have a backup than have one fail and be caught without a light source.These are very tactical looking, but they are NOT built with tactical uses in mind. I certainly wouldn't trust my life to one of these lights. They are great for the money, but you do get what you pay for. Speaking of which, this light is nowhere near 300 lumens on a standard AA alkaline battery. With a lithium battery, it's definitely brighter, but it's still not 300 lumens. I'd highly recommend using a lithium cell with this light, both for the brightness advantages and for the ability to recharge your battery since these will run through a standard AA decently quick.Last thing to mention - I LOVE the beam adjustment of this light. It's extremely easy to operate one-handed, and you can change the focus of the beam very quickly since you are pushing\/pulling the lens assembly instead of turning it. This also lends itself well to being able to maintain a better grip on the light while adjusting the beam. At the tightest focus, you do get a square light pattern like you see in some of the customer images, but I've grown to like that. On a dark night, it's like having a miniature spot light, the beam focuses so tightly.","406":"This small flashlight is small and shines very bight. Great deal for 2 Flashlights!","407":"Great little flashlights, make good gifts.  Sturdy and provide bright light.","408":"awesome  little  lights","409":"Very nice, works great","410":"I got them today n love them. Small n handy. I put one in my daughters car","411":"I like these little light, bought for the tool box, and are bright,","412":"Small, incredibly bright, and I love that it comes in a pair.","413":"It is a pleasant surprise to see so much value in such a little package.  I have no way of confirming if it's 300 lums or not.  But I can say that it is far brighter than other LED lights.  Unlike other LEDs, this has a very white light without a blue tinge. My version does only on\/off, I tried as one of the reviewer has posted in the video.  I purchased it from Warm-Mart.Shipping took about 3 weeks to arrive at the east coast.","414":"Great, powerful little flashlight that can focus its beam. Seems solid and sturdy.","415":"I got these for my older sons. They are very durable and compact. The light is bright enough. Good buy.","416":"The specs on this light say \"up to 300 lumens\" but that is ONLY if you use a 14500 li-ion cell, not a regular AA battery and even then the light is still not 300 lumens, more like 200 but still nice and bright for a $5 light. A 14500 cell is the same size as your average AA battery, but provides almost twice the power and are also rechargeable.  IMPORTANT: If you decide to purchase a 14500 cell PLEASE buy a high quality one such as AW brand and make sure it is a PROTECTED 14500 CELL, and stay away from the xxxxxfire brands commonly found on eBay as these cells can be very dangerous. Please do some research on li-ion  cells before buying them. Other than that, great little light :)","417":"They work great, my some love them. Had a little problem figuring them out, but good now.","418":"These are great, I have 4 and use them daily.  Co-workers are jealous because they are actually great lights at a great price. 100x better than those cheap LED lights you but at certain (cheap) stores.  I have dropped mine from over 10 feet and they still work like a champ!  The best part is you can put a rechargeable AA batteries in this bad boy and save a lotta $ in the long run. Price has gone up quite a bit since I bought them , otherwise I would have bought more for my co-workers...","419":"nice for a small every day use","420":"Pretty Good, Not as expected for any pinpoint viewing, also the AA battery depletes very fast. However, When you get 4 of them with the Flash Mode, you got yourself an Instant Seizure!","421":"pleased with purchase, just as described","422":"Given its sub $7 price tag, I bought this thinking having another flashlight never hurts - so definitely not expecting much. All this changed as soon as I took took delivery and fired it up - this is a well-made, very bright flashlight! The adjustable beam is a nice feature, but overall, solid construction, brighter beam than a few other LED flashlights I own which costs 3-4X. Excellent value.","423":"These are amazingly good little flashlights.  Ten stars for the set!","424":"The small flash lights are just what we needed.  They work just fine.","425":"very bright. Love the AA battery size. I assume it can burn for many hours?","426":"you get what pay for","427":"great ,  small but powerful .","428":"The lights are great LED lights. They came in handy during a recent camping trip and a late night going trip. Great Bargain!!","429":"these lights work great  nice and bright good to keep in auto just  incase thx","430":"This flash light is pretty ridiculous. It's very powerful for its size and its single battery seems to last it forever. I even like to use this as a little portable lamp in my room at night time, and i have left it on all night before by accident and still didn't have to replace the battery.This product is highly recommended.","431":"Love these flashlights! It does everything it said it would do!","432":"One worked and the other would not.","433":"Works as advertised. No issues.","434":"I ordered one of these for each of our cars along with a pack of the 14500 Li Ion batteries from fleabay.  It works really well and seems pretty well constructed.  I like being able to use the Li Ion for rechargeable and extra brightness and the AA for quick and easy power anywhere.  The only complaint I can think of is the zoom is a little cheap feeling, but not terrible.","435":"This product came quickly and in perfect condition. Easy to use, accurate, durable, and very useful in our camping night. Great buy.","436":"i like this flashlight, its size and weight are perfect for its performance","437":"Right size. Easy to store in small emergency bag.","438":"After getting screwed by the seller Vaya I bought this 2 pack. Not bad for a $4 flashlight. The clips are strong, might have to modify the clip. I'm happy with this product. Get what you pay for. I waited nearly 2 months for the Vaya and never did get it. This one I got overnight.","439":"fantastic lights! great value super bright.","440":"These units are very bright and powerful. Small but mighty. Fits in a glove box very well.","441":"Very inexpensive and bright. Good to have as backups around the house or for camping","442":"Got a good deal on these $5 s piece, are very bright, or dimmer battery saving mode as well as strobe.","443":"these little flash lights pack a punch!","444":"These flashlights had high and low beam as well flashers...my only complaint their size..looking at the picture,I was expecting something bigger.","445":"Amazing,,,,,,i vowed never to buy anything from China again. But when a friend showed me this I was amazed. It produces the light of a flashlight three times its size. I bought five. Same quality, same light, same durability. I intend to buy more. I put one in the car, house, attic, and gave away the other two. Buy this, you can't go wrong.","446":"Great product","447":"These are great. Experienced a power outage. We're very helpful.","448":"One of the two lights had a defective switch. The one working light is lower quality than similar products I have seen, but is bright enough. I like the size and that it takes just one AA battery. I'll keep this in my office for emergency use during power outages.","449":"Nice little flashlights... they have a distress flash as well as a dim and bright light!","450":"I use this to fend off the demons that haunt me. Works good.  So far, I am demon-less.","451":"Nice flashlights. Seem to be durable and perfect fit for a pocket.","452":"These are very nice, sturdy little flashlights, and it's hard to beat the price. They might not be as bright as other flashlights, but they certainly put out enough light for my needs.","453":"One would not work. Amazon returned it. Don\u2019t like the strobe light function.","454":"unbelievable how bright for a little light with rechargeable battery. great price","455":"These things are quality, didn't even know they had three light settings with purchase, pleasant surprise. Gonna buy my brother a couple","456":"For something as inexpensive as this was, it works well.  The clip on it is the one thing that distinguishes it form most of the other ones I see.  It has a very bright light.  The only problem I had was mine, not the products - it took me a while to figure out where and how to get it open to stick a battery in it.","457":"Small and powerful!","458":"Good little flash light.","459":"Very well made aluminum lights for a great price.","460":"I've now ordered 90+ of these Q5 flashlights as gifs and personal ise from several different vendors here on Amazon.com.Generally, I've been quite pleased with the quality and price.That said, the Cree Q5 adjustable focus LED flashlights I received from this vendor are of poor quality overall.I ordered 20 of the flashlights and 15 of them must have been seconds or even third quality.The hex head screws on some of the clips have been replaced with Phillips head screws and even these Phillips head screws were damaged from the install .... like they were forced in.Some of the lights have mix-n-match screws, others not.  Many of the lights showed scratches from previous use.  Not what I expected ... not even close.Even the boxed packaging with bubblewarap inserts shows signs of previous use - tape pulled off, crushed, etc.Generally, I think this lot of Cree Q5 LED was of poor quality (2nds or worse) as I said above.I personally wouldn't order from this vendor ever again - no mater what the price stated.BEWARE, some of the vendors for these flashlights are better that others ... this one seems to sell items of poor quality and passes them off as 1st quality. They are not even close.I hope this information from an experienced customer of these flashlights helps.I read these reviews to help me make an informed decision - I hope you do as well.  They have proved quite handy.If I should receive any satisfaction from this seller I will do what I can to update this review to something better.I don't expect that I will though.  We'll see ...Others I have ordered from have received rave to good reviews - quite the opposite with this seller.  D+ at best.","461":"one broke  the other was lost","462":"Bought them because who wouldn't want to have a tactical flash light for about $7? My friends and I laughed that we all had one for the same reason lol Until I had to use it during Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, it is a really good product.","463":"i ordered 2 of these due to the price. I thought what the heck, if they are no good i havent lost much. Surprisingly, these little flashlights are pretty damned good. You can adjust the beam from wide to very focused and when focused it goes a long way.Not the best flashlight ive seen or own, but it appears to be well constructed....Good buy for the money.","464":"Very bright and compact.  Work great around the grill.","465":"Perfect size for evening walks!  Nice and bright for the size!","466":"low price and perfect around the house. I slip one on my belt and take to job sites . Good light and easy to use","467":"This is an excellent flashlight for the money. I ended up buying three more after my original purchase and have stashed the spares in my car, in my work vest, and in my kitchen. The beam is adjustable so you can light up everything in front of you or something off in the distance. Such a good value for this thing. I'll probably end up ordering more.","468":"goes perfectly with my bug out bag","469":"The flashlights are light weight and very bright. Once you put the battery on it's a bit difficult to put the bottom back on. But it's a clear white light and not that yellow hue. So it's a great find especially since you get two! I use them when I'm walking around at night and it doesn't take up space at all.","470":"These lights are EXCELLENT for the price!","471":"Don't use to often very bright.Broken spring not making good contact. After changing battery.iI initially gave it 5 Stars but changed it after it stopped.working.","472":"The button doesn't seem to have an actuation point so you seem to have to press rather firmly to change light settings but some times it actuates with little pressure. Edges on the frame feel uncomfortable.","473":"Terrific lights you can carry for a walk, etc.  Fits in your pocket. Recommended.","474":"Light is bright, material is good and it worked as advertised","475":"I was skeptical at first that it would be close to meeting expectations but after using it for a couple of weeks, the battery life is pretty good considering it only uses one AA battery.  The light is focused and very bright.  I did not purchase the 3.7v battery so I don't know if it could reach the super brightness but it is really bright, exp considering it only has one battery.  For the price, this is a great. I will be ordering more.","476":"Best frickin lil light at great price you can see 300 feet in the dark I have bought over 20 of them . JUST AWESOME PRODUCT","477":"Works well. Thank you.","478":"These lights are Bright !!!!!  Very heavy made.  For this price I suggest them for everyone.  Great stocking stuffers.","479":"My Darling just rolls her eyes when another flashlight shows up at the door :)  .  For the price, we can put one of these in each vehicle(within driver's reach AND in the cargo area, so TWO in each vehicle) and all the other locations where I want a flashlight within arms length.From a design standpoint, the clip on this light is extremely tight and forcing this over a pocket flap or slash pocket could result in some serious wear on the fabric, not to mention finger tips.  The tactical grippy ribs just below the clip are darned pronounced, so it takes a bit of 'doing' to use the clip effectively.  I don't commonly use the clip...I'll just carry the light or leave it in my pocket when not in use.  I use this frequently when walking the Scottie-girl Katie.  Naturally, it's not as bright as some of my 3xAAA lights; but this packs a might punch for its size.  The focus feature is a little slippy, but it does the job if you're willing to hold it in place OR set the light in a stationary position.I haven't had one of these 'conk out' on me like so many other inexpensive lights.  This is a great value for this type of light, IMO.  Great stocking stuffer or just a very useful item for the backpack, purse, car, utility drawer, tool box, etc, etc.","480":"As I received flashlight, I was impressed with the solid metal construction. After inserting 1 AA battery, a very bright light was emitted with a push of the orange rubber button on the end. Pulling on the head adjusts the focus of the beam, which can be adjusted to either be very tight or spread out. I highly recommend this to someone looking for a nice looking metal construction compact flashlight.","481":"It would've been nice if you could've adjusted the size of the light ? But still enjoy the light.","482":"great little light for working on cars underneath them it is very durable light takes a lot of abuse thankyou.","483":"Highly potent beams, sturdy and compact, great flashligths.","484":"They look nice but bad quality, they rarely come on when u push the button.  Have to twist the battery cover part to get it to work","485":"Good solid little flashlight.The thing I really like about it is the amount of light it puts out.I ended up getting 4.One for the house,one for my truck and two for gifts.When I bought them they came from China with free shipping.It took like 4 weeks to get here but 4 flashlights for less than $12","486":"I installed the batteries and they both worked great.","487":"Works great.  I like having only one AA batter to replace.","488":"Not as bright I thought it would have but works good.","489":"Very bright and efficient. Easy to use.","490":"Really impressed with this flashlight given the small size of it.  It's adjustable so you can extend the front of it to light up more surface area or return it to normal position for more direct light.  It also has a \"strobe mode\" where it flashes very quickly...you know, in case you want to have a dance party with it.In all seriousness, you can't go wrong this little guy...The casing is also very solid and the quality is there, doesn't feel cheap whatsoever.2 Thumbs up!","491":"Small and powerful","492":"Too small for regular use. They are listed as  mini though.","493":"Very bright and good for the price!","494":"This was a daily deal.  Gave one to my husband-he loves it.","495":"GReat Product!","496":"Not as bright as expected. One very irritating feature is that pressing the ON button cycles through the flashlight's modes. So, whenever you turn it on, it turns on in low light, strobe, or high (in that order).","497":"Great, sturdy little light for the money. A lot of light from such a small flashlight.","498":"You'll get a flashlight all right, but the quality will be somewhat random. In my case, the features across the 4 flashlights I ordered were different: One just didn't have the strobe option, and one didn't have any options.  If I hadn't ordered 4 of the same flashlights, I'd swear I ordered them incorrectly.","499":"thank you","500":"Honestly not worth it I tried to use them for work and they worked half the time. The light would randomly start to change then just stop working. Just stay away from these","501":"Only one works. The one that does is mediocre at best.","502":"Bright, works great.  Warning - keep away from kids.  Disconcertingly way too bright for the little ones.","503":"Great for hikes. Light. Easy to use","504":"Wow these work great, can't believe you get 2","505":"I work on the field all day long, and can tell you I wouldn't sell or change this Torch for ANYTHING (well OK, maybe a million dollars).I'm serious, this thing will light up an entire case, heck even an entire 25ft sq. room. You wouldn't believe the density of this thing and the the illumination power. WOW!! Extremely pleased!!!!!! A+++","506":"Works great, small, light and bright,","507":"It's okay.","508":"Not what i got as advertised. When you zoom in it doesnt even look like the LED shape, it is blurry and week. Quality wasn't the greatest when i took the flashlight apart. Electronics were not well put together and weren't held in place.","509":"Good flashlights so far. touch design. bright light.","510":"One out of 4 light was bad, other than that was ok.","511":"Weird it doesn't come with batteries","512":"Theses are very nice soon buy some more","513":"Very bright and durable","514":"For $4.50? This is nuts. One for each car.","515":"for the price its worth it. no batteries included.","516":"Nice value! Decent flashlights.","517":"VERY small in size (like 3 inches at most). Good for purses or kids backpacks.They work well tho.","518":"Bright, nice portable size.  they fit in my glove box.","519":"For the price I paid, I got a lot of 'bang for my buck'. Metal casing feels strong, only uses 1 battery, it has 2 brightness settings plus a blinking setting, you can adjust the size of the beam, includes a pocket clip and fits in the palm of your hand. I wouldn't recommend it for heavy duty use since it will get lost due to it's size, the adjustable tip will come off and it's not very bright, but for around the house its great.","520":"I liked the price of these lights and from after reading some reviews on them compared to other led lights, I thought I would give it a shot and try them out.  I bought two of them and I wish I would have bought 4.  The only issue I can see is that they came from China and by the time they showed up, I had forgot about them.","521":"Fair value, very cheap and functional.","522":"Great product, well worth the money....","523":"Awesome little flashlights. Super powerful and bright. Would recommend.","524":"Really bright,  especially for the size.  Took them camping for the weekend,  they worked great!","525":"Bright, small, adjustable.  I love these","526":"Ok nothing spectacular","527":"Used around 10 times, already stopped working, when you can get it to turn on it goes from high to low to flashing all by its self!","528":"Very practical flashlight. Comes in handy  for this nurse!","529":"A must for everyone. Works very well","530":"good lights and feel sturdy but way smaller than expected.","531":"Got the light after like a month but that was expected after reading the other reviews. The first thing I noticed is the wight of the light. It feels solid and of nice construction. I then noticed a long scratch on the plastic lens. I wrote to the seller hoping that I can get a replacement lens. It is very bright even with just a normal AA and not any special lithium battery. I like the three settings (high, low, and strobe) It also has O-rings on all of the seams so it might be somewhat water resistant but probably only to the extent that it an be used in light rain without breaking. The front of the light could be used as a glass break if it was necessary since it is sharp and just long enough it it is held right.TL;DR nice light, takes long to receive, came with scratched plastic lens, good deal.","532":"Small and powerful...just like me :)","533":"Wish they were smaller, but very good light source, and good price. Would buy again.","534":"Great deal on a 4 pack. Light works good.","535":"What a great price you just can't beat it.","536":"This is the best little flashlight.  It is so bight and such a good size for my purse.  I gave the other one to a friend, who was delighted to receive it.I love it.","537":"They are low cost. run on regular alkaline batteries, put out a surprising amount of light without sucking all the juice out of it's battery quickly and they are just the right size. The light spot is evenly distributed, useful, and adjustable to boot. Worth what I paid.","538":"Very good.","539":"great","540":"Very good lights use them to look into computers and copiers. Came in real handy during the tropical storm..","541":"Very cheap flashlight that puts out a ton of light that is also focusable. Definitely use rechargeables in this flashlight because it will drain your batteries in about an hour and half. It does put out a ton of light which I like very much.","542":"great value","543":"Awesome Product works really good.","544":"I'm amazed that something so cool can be so inexpensive.","545":"Nice product for a good price. Wish it had a setting to remember the last light mode used instead of having to cycle through all the settings each time you turn the light off.","546":"This is an incredibly cool flashlight.  Very powerful for the size.  Impressed with quality. Great deal!","547":"Never can have enough flashlights!","548":"Although I'd read good reviews of these, I didn't expect all that much from a $5 flashlight. But I needed something like this to keep in the car and figured it'd be OK for that sort of occasional use. It took several weeks to arrive and was very simply packaged. When I unwrapped it, though, I was impressed by the heft and workmanship. Then I popped in a battery and, wow, it was amazingly bright! I was also happy to find that it focused easily, allowing for a wide, soft beam or a narrow, sharp one that could illuminate things at a considerable distance. A friend was so impressed, I immediately ordered another for him.","549":"I bought two of these. They are nice little lights, using only one AA battery. I'd say they're pretty bright for the size and for only using one AA. Build quality is pretty good, definitely can't complain for the price. The focus zoom is handy. You won't get 300 lumens with regular AA alkaline batteries though. Overall 4 stars.","550":"Rockbirds LED Flashlight is a very high quality, heavy duty, and super bright tactical flashlight.  Extremely satisfied with this product!","551":"Great deal. Size and weight have made them a go to light for camping, hiking, or working around the yard\/home.","552":"Great gifts","553":"Great little flashlight for the price, super bright and sturdy.","554":"Works very well with AA, with TrustFire 14500 this is unbelieveable, definitely the brightest flashlight I have seen with the lion.  I'm not to worried about fire\/explosion since this only uses one cell.  Bought two of these, two 14500 batteries, and two handlebar mounts for riding at night and am happy with the results.","555":"These are great","556":"Very bright","557":"After more than 30 days of waiting (I ordered these in November) I finally wrote to the company and told them that I stilldid not receive my flashlights. They wrote back the next day and seemed friendly and helpful.They said items may have been lost in shipping. They asked if I wanted a refund or to resend items.I said resend as I already waited this long. Finally after more than 45 days I finally received these babies.You really can't go wrong for the price (at the time I paid $4.99 each)  They're very bright and handyaround the house and car. I'm an avid fan of Fenix Flashlights so you really can't comparethese to Fenix products but I was pleasantly surprised to see how good the quality build is.3 modes: bright, medium and strobe. From flood to spotlight with an easy flick of your finger.So if you can wait forever to get these, I would recommend them as they only use one AA batteryas opposed to an expensive CR123A Lithium. I gave a couple to my friends and family and they're very happywith them. The lights seem pretty solid and overall I'm happy with these although in thetime it took to get to me I could've walked over there to get them myself.For the price and quality I give these 5 stars.","558":"Works great.","559":"very good","560":"These are the best little flashlight I have ever bought (and I have lots and lots of flashlights).  I am always surprised how quickly they arrive and I keep ordering more to give as gifts but I just can't seem to let them go I like them so much.  Maybe if I order 20 more I'll be able to give one away.  Put the 3.6 vt 14500 battery in it and its nearly as bright as a car headlight!","561":"I really like this product. They are the perfect soze.","562":"good size and bright enough  for the price.","563":"Great product","564":"Bright light! Happy with it.","565":"good little and bright light","566":"I have two of these lights, and use them every day. They are the brightest flashlights you are likely to find for that price.They are shipped from China, so it takes a long time to get here, but well worth the wait.Only gripe is that battery life isn't very long, and there is no low power option, but I'm happy with mine.","567":"Nice, durable flashlights that are surprisingly very bright. This was a great addition to my emergency pack.","568":"nice and bright","569":"Perfect size for my purse.","570":"They work great.","571":"what a great deal","572":"Great product.","573":"Small and very bt\\right.","574":"This is the 2nd set of RockBirds I have purchased! Love this product! Sturdy, powerful beam, lightweight an compact!","575":"good value","576":"Works as expected good product! A+","577":"Nice and bright and well made.  I recommend.","578":"Great lights","579":"by the picture it would appear to be a good light but when I got it it was flimsy plastic, and ready for the trashDON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","580":"Good bang for the dollar.","581":"good product","582":"Battery lasts quite a long time. I bought several and keep them stashed in case we need them. I use them all the time for evening hikes with the toddler who loves to hold one of his own.","583":"I ordered five of these little buggers because for the price, they're cheaper than many disposable flashlights.They just arrived today, so this is just my initial impression of them for what it matters...First, they seem to be solidly built.  They are metal and while the construction may be a bit crude (screws holding the clip on), they don't feel cheap.Secondly, the all worked.  I read where a few people got inoperable ones, but I put AA batteries in all five and they worked as promised.Thirdly, they are bright.  Well, bright enough.  They don't rival the much more expensive flashlight I primarily use on duty (especially when it comes to range), but for the inside of a vehicle or other closer confines they light everything up well and with a nice, clear white light.Lastly, I like that they use inexpensive AA batteries and not CR123 ones like my main flashlight.So, what's the down side?  For one, I don't like the toggle switch being how you cycle through the beams (high, low and strobe).  I wish it was only an off\/on switch with a separate one for each cycle as it is on my considerably more expensive light; but for the price I can live with it.Outside of that, these are great \"stashable\" flashlights in that for the price, you can buy many of them and stuff them where you might need them (in the car, in a drawer, in a jacket pocket, etc).  I hope they last, I will be disappointed if they didn't.  Otherwise, I suggest snatching up several of them.Oh, and since they come from Asia, they will take several weeks to show up.  Be patient, they're worth the wait.In a nutshell, these are not flashlights that I would stake my life on; but for utilitarian purposes they are excellent choices, especially for the price!  I plan to use these a lot to preserve the battery on my primary flashlight!","584":"Really great flashlights. Well made, bright light! A great buy!","585":"I have an assortment of SODIAL, UltraFire and another brand which have all worked well for me.  All these lights really work best with a 14500 battery.  However if you working in a shop or around the house - you may want to use an AA battery so it will not be so bright!!  Got 10 of these for Christmas presents.","586":"Great product","587":"They work and price is unbeatable.","588":"Pretty brigt for their size","589":"The light is much brighter when you use 14500 3.7 v battery.","590":"Very nice-was a gift. Fast shipping","591":"they are very useful","592":"tiny flashlights big area of light! A++","593":"Does not return to bright after powering off, full clicks cycle through modes the same way that half-clicks do. Brightness seems below what is advertised. Will likely return.","594":"I love them the,1 fo me and 1 for mom very bright!!","595":"Nice light.","596":"Works fine for close up lighting but distance is a problem.  Not the brightest either.","597":"Great lights.","598":"Just the right size for pocket, good light ,variable beam great to work with, bottom line for the price you can't lose","599":"I did not expect much from this light at this price, but I did expect it to last longer than one day.  It did not.","600":"The zoom does not work on any of the flashlights I received. I do not recommend this flashlight.","601":"Nice","602":"Bought as a gift.","603":"A great light for little bucks.","604":"As arrived, upon inserting the battery, the flashlight didn't turn on.  Only 1 of the flashlights worked.  The second flashlight, trash.","605":"Theyre flashlights, not incredible, not bad.","606":"For the price, fantastic product.","607":"These little flashlights are mighty. They feel like they are going to last, metal not plastic.  Lots of light!","608":"Light is weak, the strobe-light is pointless, and maybe just barely worth $5. Expected more quality, but it's all looks.","609":"One did not work. Switched the tail caps and they both work for now.. . It gives a good amount of light, but 3 stars because now I can\u2019t rely on the light.","610":"Works very good","611":"Ok for  a kid","612":"I use this little flashlight in remodeling and it provides a very bright light. The focus feature is surprisingly well controlled and easy to use with one hand. The ability to hold standard AAA batters is convenient. The clip is perhaps a bit tight, but that is better than too loose. I am very happy with this purchase.","613":"Awesome! Really brute for its size. 1 AA battery is all it needs.  Kids love playing with the 'blinking feature.","614":"These small flashlights are a lifesaver!","615":"they are cool","616":"These things are CRAZY bright!  If you get the more powerful batteries, it's even better.  This will shine like 5 blocks down my street.  I used the strobe function to scare away some kids who were beating up on another kid.  They thought it was the cops coming.  Very bright light!","617":"Fantastic deal.  Buy it.","618":"Husband loves them.","619":"Super bright and only takes one AA cell.  Seems very sturdy.","620":"Nice flashlight, very bright and well constructed.  It workes great.  The zoom took me a second to figure out as I sat there twisting the end.  I found out you have to pull it,  And when zoomed to the fullest the beam is the shape of the LED and circuit board inside.  Still, for the price, it's a small incovenience to zoom out one notch to get back to the round beam shape and it's still very bright","621":"Really like these flashlights! Work very well. Very useful.","622":"He loves the brightness and focusability of this nice little and inexpensive Cree LED light.  He carries it almost everywhere.  Seems rugged enough to stand up to every-day-carry-in-your-pocket use from a teenage boy, so I'd say it's tough and pretty well made.","623":"These are cery good flashlights and exactly what I expected. Flashlight doesnt stay on the same mode when turning off and on, but they do have a bright, dim, and strobe, and you can change the mode with a half push of the button while it is on.","624":"Well made, really inexpensive","625":"These are rated to work with AA size & the 14500 Li-Ion type batteries. I put in an AA battery and was impressed by the quality of \"white\" this flashlight had; it was bright too! The 14500 batteries arrived so after a little charging I put one in; the light quickly died within a few seconds. Customer service was very helpful and say they will credit my purchase. Don't put 14500's in these expecting a long life.","626":"Very unhappy with these -- they feel cheap, and one looks like it's been damaged. And now I find out that I can't return them.","627":"Great for the price.No complaints so far.","628":"Good","629":"great item","630":"good","631":"I was so impressed by the first set that I ordered a second set. Will make a great Christmas gift. Heavy duty and great lighting.","632":"Blinding light one battery love it","633":"Great pocket sized flashlight. These are the best around. Super bright and I love that these can switch in several modes. Flash light can dim to safe on battery life, zoom in for a smaller focus, flash patterns, this is a must for every bug out bag or emergency kit","634":"One of them, the threads holding the battery cap in, stripped the first time that I took it off.","635":"Nice bright lights. You get what you paid for, nothing special. I would recommend them.","636":"Rugged, great brightness. WIll get lots of use.","637":"The flashlight description stated online does not match the actual product. The product zoom is COMPLETELY different as stated in the pictures shown as what it actually does. Will keep flashlight, but not happy description and actually product functions do not match!!!","638":"Awesome little flashlights!!!  Very bright. Would recommend getting. I am buying a second set.","639":"U get what u pay for","640":"I purchased the 2 pack. They arrived quickly. Only take 1 AA battery and it was easy to install. I bought them so I could keep one in my cars glovebox and one either on me or in my apt. For the price they are perfect. Heavy duty housing that doesn't feel cheap. Also has strobe function.","641":"Only one out of the two worked.  Something in the switching mechanism that turns the light on and off did not work.","642":"When I click the button it shines brightly","643":"My son had purchased one of these from another source.  I really liked it since it gives a great deal of light and has the ability to make  the beam wide or narrow.  REALLY BRIGHT! and it uses ONE AA battery.  Other bright flashlights use those button batteries that are annoying to locate and purchase.","644":"Small and bright!  Excellent!","645":"Great product at a great price!","646":"One works great and the other has a disfunction when trying to use the \u201cspot light.\u201d  It won\u2019t stay in place and I manually have to hold it.","647":"Awesome produced, you will not be disappointed.","648":"They're very small, but work well for a 4 inch flashlight","649":"cheap item but excellent","650":"Works very well..","651":"Very well made and super bright.","652":"First I bought 2 in case I liked them.  This order was for 4.  My \"Number One\" flashlight was a 5 \"D\" Cell Mag Light until I found the Mini Cree.  Both are adjustable from a wide beam to a spot but the Cree weighs nothing compared to the Mag.  And certainly replacing 1 \"AA\" cell id much more economical than replacing 5 \"D\" cells.  The only thing the Mag is more usefull for than the Cree is as a weapon.","653":"Have only used a few times but are so far they are good, especially for the price paid.","654":"Excelent","655":"Bought these as back up flashlights for the recent hurricane season. They work great. Light weight. Good price.","656":"Good quality.","657":"They ran all night during hurricane Irma. Really did the job! Great quality.","658":"Thank you","659":"Small compact light that you carry every day.  So far great light. Only time will tell how durable and dependable it is.","660":"Loved it at first, but after dropping it once, the flashlight will not turn on. I tried replacing the battery, and looking inside to see if I could fix it. I don't see any way.","661":"It is what it is, a cheap not so powerful flashlight. It looks like an adult flashlight but it is more for children.I gave it to my kid so that he's got one for his school bag just in case.","662":"Super bright. The cheaply made clip broke off after 2 weeks. Now the power button has issues, sometimes it will turn off and you have to bang it against something to get it to turn back on. Other than that it's pretty good.","663":"Just received these today. So far so good, not super bright but not bad either. They feel a little \"flimsy\" so not sure how long they will hold up. About what you'd expect for $9, definitely wouldn't spend more than that.","664":"good","665":"The light is great and the price is right.  Uses a AA battery and produces a lot of light with the choice of focusing the beam into what looks like a little LED diode.  If you don't mind waiting 3-4 weeks, this light is great.As far as the belt clip, it is snug but works fine on a fairly thick belt.","666":"Buy many, keep them everywhere. AA battery is a major advantage, some have.shelf-lives of decades, means always ready in boat, car or outhouse.","667":"two small flashlights that light things you point at.","668":"One of the two lights I received does not work.  I didnt know it was not returnable before receiving it.","669":"Great for the pocket and traveling","670":"A perfect flashlight,it\u2019s easy to carry .The light is very bright and I don't have to worry about keeping spare batteries around for it. I bought this for my daughter  dand she  loves it.","671":"Work great and bright","672":"This little guy uses only one AA battery but has a very powerful beam. The adjustment goes from very wide to very concentrated easily. Great for your jacket pocket, briefcase, or glove box. Sweet deal. I got two and the wife grabbed one right away due to it's versatility.","673":"great!","674":"Ordered these for our staff to use in field. They took forever to arrive (about 2 weeks). All in all they work very well, and serve their purpose, but they make a weird cross shape when you focus the light to a tight space.","675":"Pretty good, well made. not real sure about 300L","676":"This little bugger is probably the smallest and brightest LED flashlight I've ever seen!! The overall build quality is that of a $20+ dollar light. It feels small in the hand, but very durable. The adjustable focus is very smooth, and the 3 operating modes (bright, dim, and bright strobe) and pretty easy to use. I've been using it for the past 3 nights to walk the dog, and am still on the first AA I put into it. Its been running for 45 minuets a night for 3 nights, with no visible change in brightness or distance. I am not using any special batteries, just plain generic brand AA's from my local Home Depot.Pro: Super bright, adjustable focus, multiple operating modes, runs on 1 AA battery, all metal body constructionCons: On\/Off button can be a little hard to press while holding the light.  On a side note: shipping time to the states is rather long, as I believe it ships from somewhere in Asia.**Bottom line: Super bright, all metal, LED flash light in a small, durable package. The most affordable super bright LED light I've found so far, and my favorite to use.","677":"Don't buy the cheapo they sell at the dollar store! This product is solid and hefty with a nice adjustable lens and a powerful light. I bought 4 more to give to the fam. Unusually good product for the money.","678":"Bought 4 of these from Tosell888. They all worked perfectly. These only have on\/off function, no other modes. They seem solidly built and put out a good amount of light. The lens slides forward and back to change the size of the beam.","679":"Thank you for the Rockbirds LED Flashlights.  They are excellent and meet my every need.  I have have used them almost daily.  The brightess of the light is great and they hold a charge over a longer period of time.","680":"best single AA battery flashlight","681":"Very disappointing one of the lights doesn't open, but the one that works is very bright.","682":"Also the battery seems to last fairly long, the little focus ring on the front seems to be very loose on one that I got and too tight on the other.  They dont fit inside the rail attachment on a one inch attachment I purchased at the Gun show but they perform well.","683":"Good to have","684":"I like","685":"When I bought a $5 \"300lm\" flashlight, I considered that the specs may be a bit exaggerated, but 200lm would still make this flashlight a great deal, 100lm would have made this flashlight a good deal, 50lm would be a disappointment, but then I would have got what I paid for....What I revived was 20lm flashlight (from 10 feet on medium beam, you can look into this flashlight without discomfort) that I had to wait over a month for.  I bought my kids $3 key chain flashlights that are as bright as the one I received.I ordered this item from another vendor, paid .50 cents more and received a ~100lm flashlight (if the 120lm $35 Gander Mountain flashlight is truly 120lm).  The other was a \"good\" deal and not bad for what I paid.","686":"I ordered two just to see how much I would like this light. This is a really good light to keep in the backpack, car, or just around the house. A few sharp edges on it, so around children might need some attention. Granted the machining isn't flawless, but considering it's a $4 light I am really impressed. A coworker talked me out of one of the two lights and a few others in the office bought them after seeing it in person. I am about to go order a few more for myself.","687":"I really liked these.. Until they just broke about a month after use. Changing battery and then never worked again. Same for both flashlights in pack","688":"No durability, both of them broke quickly after purchase.","689":"Excellent flashlight!  Love it.  Very bright.  Requires only one battery.  Would buy more if needed.","690":"Good little lights for the money.","691":"Very great LED flashlights for last minute emergencies I definitely recommend this.","692":"Great little flashlight, all of mine working so far. I know some reviewers have had some bad ones here and there, not me. Very bright and I like the fact that they only require one AA battery instead of 3 AAA batteries like some others I have had.","693":"These are totally unreliable. Most of the time they don't On when you need them to.","694":"Good stuff. Compact and effective.","695":"These are GREAT!","696":"The best! Love that it uses 1 AA cell. Bought 2 more for Xmas presents.","697":"Very bright and compact","698":"Great Value","699":"These things are great.  They are cheap enough you can stash them all over the place and have at least one when you need it.  I like that you can focus the beam too depending on what you need to do with it.","700":"Pretty nice flashlight.  Brought it out for a winter camping trip and found the light to be a great brightness for night time use.  I find the slide focus absolutely useless since it can easy be hit back out of focus by anything.  This light is NOT 300lm from what i can tell from using it, so one star gone for that.","701":"love them","702":"5 out of 6 were good.","703":"Bright light","704":"Very nice! A luxury box to cover these items.","705":"I really have no idea how they can make this machined aluminum light with the many parts from different sources and sell\/ship for this money! 1AA bat does the job for me. Very nice. Heck the shipping in U.S.A. costs more than this!","706":"I ordered two and one arrived broken. The seller shipped me a replacement for free (did not require me to return the broken one), but since they are shipped from China this took a few weeks. The lights are quite bright and I like the ability to adjust the focus.","707":"Sturdy little lights that work every time as advertised","708":"I was leary about purchasing this light as the price seemed too low for a quality product. Boy was I surprised. This torch is very bright and made of metal not plastic and uses a standard AA battery. I would recommend purchasing this item.","709":"The flashlights haven't been very durable. The back button get's kind of finicky where you have to click it several times for it to turn back on.","710":"I normally don't bother to review stuff, but I am very impressed with this torch and want to share some information that could be useful to others.There are multiple sellers for this item, and I suspect that the item quality may vary depending on the seller and the source\/timing of their stock. I bought mine from Warm Mart around Oct 20. The item is shipped from Hong Kong, and took 2.5 weeks to arrive.This little torch looks more expensive than the $5 I paid for it. It's made from metal, heavy (for its size), and has a tactical bezel that looks like it can be used to break glass.The orange switch works reliably. There are other versions of this torch out there that has multiple settings - high, low, strobe. The one I received only has 2 settings though - on and off.It only requires a single AA battery, which is nice. It works great with rechargeable NiMH batteries. I tried an Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable battery on the torch and left the light on to see how long it'll last - it lasted more that 4 hours on a single charge! I don't know exactly how long it lasted as I gave up checking after 4 hours. What's also amazing is that the brightness stays pretty constant over 3+ hours. Regular torchlights tend to get dimmer as its battery drains - not this one.How bright is this torchlight? I have other LED torchlights for comparison - i.e. a typical pocket LED torch with 9 LEDs, running on 3xAAA and sells for a few dollars. This torchlight blows that one away - it's at least a couple of times brighter. It also emits a bright white light instead of the bluish-white light that other LED torchlights produce.This torch also has a bezel that you can move in or out, to adjust the beam. On the 'wide' setting, it produces a very evenly lit circular spot. When used in the dark, the 'beam' setting will easily light up something that's 50+ feet away. The 'beam' setting looks strange though as it produces a squarish spot that is essentially an image of the Cree LED's surface.It puts my other regular LED torches to shame. Wife initially balked when I bought another torchlight; when I turned it on, she wants me to buy a few more! A friend that I've shown it to now wants to get one.","711":"Good quality for the price.  Feel sturdy.","712":"Overall a very useful light. However be aware that it chews up AA batteries. Battery life is frankly awful.","713":"LOVE LOVE LOVE these little gems. I had bought one last year and all the leaders on a Scout trip were amazed at how bringht and how far this thing would throw it's light.I bought two more to equip all my packs.I wish it did have the three mode setup (flashing) vs jsut on\/off on the ones I rxd hence the 4 vs 5 stars.You won't be disappointed at the price point these are selling","714":"Good, sturdy, bright flashlight.","715":"From the looks of other reviews you have to get lucky to get a good one.  Mine is great.Mine has three settings. High, low, and epileptic seizure inducing strobe modes. You can cycle through them by turning it off\/on or you can half press the button without clicking it and it cycles through the three on modes.","716":"These are great... great size, excellent beam.  Used them while camping.","717":"Very good deal. Same light I've purchased several times on DX.com, but it was delivered MUCH swifter.  This one has 3 settings unlike the others.  Just tap the on\/off buttom to toggle between super (blinding) bright, 1\/2 as bright, and strobe!  OBTW, the strope worked out great last weekend for my house dance party.  Enjoy!","718":"drains my battery quick even when of, COULD BE my personal rechargeable battery that isn't working as it should. overall they both work great and as described.","719":"Very bright nice flashlight.","720":"Excellent value.","721":"I would recommend these to anyone who wants and extremely bright flashlight for its size. They fit nicely into your pocket and have multiple settings. They run on one simple AA battery and are built well. Certainly deserves a 5 star.","722":"Very small and bright using one AA battery. Very tough aluminum housing. Lense pulls in and out for focus.  There's quite a few of these LED small tactical flashlights out there and these seem to be of very good quality.  There were also very inexpensive.","723":"These were great and worth every penny.","724":"Great value for the money would recommend to all. I am an appliance repairman use one every day","725":"They work as expected.","726":"these things put out a lotta light .","727":"Surprisingly bright for size.","728":"Very small and very good quality, there are three kinds of adjustment brightness","729":"For the small price, it's a great value.  Feels of higher quality than the cheap stuff at home depot- solid metal and so far, easy on\/off and adjustment of beam.  Took a little longer to ship from hong kong, but delivered as promised no problems,","730":"Great little flashlights. Very bright, work well. I would recommend these to anyone.","731":"Bright. I like it. It's small","732":"Light does not go on sometimes and sometimes it switches itself into strobe mode on its own.","733":"I have 4 of these.All work great and very well constructed.  Strong light.I love the adjustable focus.Batteries seem to last long.I like the single AA vs fiddling with flashlights that have 3 AAA.","734":"These turned out to be great little flashlights - bright even with a AA alkaline battery and really bright with a lithium ion battery.  It took almost two months for them to arrive from China, however.","735":"Amazing little lights. Very bright and well made.Incredibly inexpensive for what you get.","736":"very nice","737":"This thing is BRIGHT!  For such a small light using 1- AA battery, the output is insane.  The lens is adjustable and goes from flood to a blinding square spot beam.  Seems to be decently made, overall I am happy.","738":"I look at this flashlight as a handy-dandy source of light which can be adjusted to narrowly light a small area or it can be adjusted again to light a larger area.  When have you ever seen something like this?  Thanks","739":"I love these things. Such a steal for the price.","740":"Nice little flashlight. A lot of light for something this size. Definitely worth the price.","741":"I purchased several of these for my vehicles, camper and even my boat. They are very dependable and they can be ordered with a strobe function. They are not the brightist on the market, but they work good.","742":"it is REALLY bright for 1 AA battary","743":"Great product","744":"Good value and quality. perfect for my needs","745":"Small but solid and bright. Three click light modes. High, low and strobe. Perfect for camping.","746":"These little guys are rugged, durable, functional, and easy to use.  Great purchase! Especially for the price, you cant go wrong.","747":"This flashlight is terrific. The light is very bright and quality is tops.The price is unbelievable. We bought 5 to have them available on each floor of our home and in each car. Definitely recommend this item.","748":"good quality, bright light and good price, best part it only use one AA battery, not too bad in case you forget to turn it off, lost only one battery.","749":"Just received mine they're pretty bright with AA battery really impressed with this product and price","750":"very nice set comes in handy, one for the wife an one for me.  I like the clip so that I cant loose it. small compact bright, great unit","751":"Retry??? Great product offers need great reviews  POSTED,  eh?","752":"Well built , compact, nice light!","753":"Plenty bright: you can see this thing casting a shadow outside on a shady day!very small: maybe 1.5 times the length of a AA batterySolid feel: it's metal baby!Slide to zoom: slide the knurled area forward","754":"EXCELLENT FLASHLIGHT ! Not sure exactly what people ,who wrote a 2 paragraph review, were expecting from a $5 flashlight !?","755":"Excellent! These are great!","756":"super product","757":"Arrived on time, although it did take about a month. Good, bright led light. Small and compact which makes it easy to carry around and store. Inexpensive and well worth the price. This is my second one.","758":"for the money you can not go wrong. Its a handy little light that is pretty bright. Good for walking the dog or checking out the yard at night without having to carry a big bulky light.","759":"Great little flash light at very good price.  I wish would have bought a few more of these when it was cheaper.  I paid around $5.40 with shipping included.  Small size is excellent for little kids.  Just don't point in the eye.","760":"I picked up a few of these flashlights for my parents and myself.  They are really small and easy to take with you or keep somewhere just in case.  The light output is great with AA, even better with 3.7v 14500 batteries.  I'm very happy with them.","761":"Solid product. Works as well as flashlights 3 or 4 times the cost of this one, at least. I will buy another pair, soon.","762":"Great deal and very small and compact.  Easily fits in a pocket or car glove box. Extremely bright!","763":"Great for suitcases, cars, etc., while traveling; we now have 5 of them for our travels.","764":"Got two of these on deal of the day.  I should have bought a dozen and stashed them everywhere.  They work great and are small enough to use wherever a light is needed.  Very intense for a small light.","765":"Good flashlight for a price.","766":"nlce flashligh like the fact aa battery","767":"Though they look similar to the popular Sipik lights, which I like, they are not as bright, nor do they focus as well.  What I was actually delivered was Ultrafire brand.  I did like the multi mode button though - high, low, pulse modes.","768":"perfect","769":"I gave these as gifts, this was my second order. Everyone who got 1 loved it. Those who didn't wanted one, thus the second order.","770":"Very lightweight and bright! adjustable brightness and beam control. Bought two of these and they are awesome. Probably buy a couple more to keep in different places in the house and car... and add to your SHTF bag.","771":"Wow, I just popped an AA battery in, and this thing is bright.","772":"Perfect","773":"Great little light. what i don't like is that they are shipped in buble wrap  and the boxes get chrushed.the lights all worked,but I give them away as gifts sometimes. Its not real impressive to give some a gift in a crushed up box!","774":"More than I expected. Got these for 5 dollars a piece.","775":"fantastic, the description is exactly like its works","776":"First off I realize these are cheap.  They are very bright but the battery last only a short period comprable to other LED flashlights.  The other thing is when you are at narrow focus the beam is square to match the LED size.","777":"handy little light to have. Like the fact in only takes 1 AA battery.","778":"They aren't very bright and only turn on half the time. Don't waste your money.","779":"They are nice spare lights.  I would probably opt for higher quality.  The focus feature is too loose.  I like the Duracell offerings better.  Higher price, but better QC, better fit and finish.","780":"Bright light and inexpensive.","781":"better than expected","782":"It's good to keep in your pocket at camping and fishing events.  While it won't light up the woods it works well for the immediate area. I didn't give it 5 stars because it took a month to receive it.","783":"Awesome flashlight for the price!","784":"One out of the two works. It did not light up when the battery was a applied.  It just over heated.","785":"Better quality than I was expecting...didn't  use yet","786":"They are small yet brilliant light. Great product!","787":"This is my fourth order of these Chinese SODIAL flashlights. The first order was excellent. They came in these little white boxes, covered with a bubble wrap bag, and had the high,low and strobe capability. The next two orders still had the boxes, but the adjustable light capability was gone. The light was either on or off now. That was OK as the quality of the unit was still high. This last order, and I emphasize last order, was crap.I received the padded envelope in the mail and could tell something was different from the prior mailings. I cut open the pouch and there were no more little white boxes. Each light was only covered by the little bubble wrap bag that was in the boxes of prior shipments. This prompted me to look further. I have at least one of the lights from each of the prior orders and I compared them this final order. I noticed a pronounced drop in the quality of the light.The sliding tube that holds the lens that focuses the light beam is very loose compared to my other lights. The on\/off button seems cheaper. Even the spring on the button is smaller than my other lights. The final test I did was to compare the light beams with an older purchase using the same battery in each light. The beam produced by the new light seemed to be less intense and the focus was not as precise as on the older model.The prior versions were a great buy for around 5 bucks. The current run is not. My suggestion is that you don't waste your money on these lights. My bet is that they will not last as long as the prior batch. I will keep this final purchase as it would cost as much as I paid for them to ship them back to China. My guess is that the cost of doing business in China is going up so the quality of their products will be decreasing. I hope this helps you save your hard earned money.","788":"pretty bright for a little flashlight.","789":"Great price, bright for a little flashlight.","790":"Great flashlight just wish you didn't have to cycle through the modes everytime.","791":"Sending tons of these al9ng with batteries and led lamps to 0yerto Rico. Folks having sone seruoys power  issues there.","792":"Super bright flashlight.  I use the lithium batteries but that's not necessary unless battery life is a concern.  Very well made.  Own a number of them and am impressed with both performance and the quality of the design.","793":"Very bright and no problems so far.","794":"Great miniature lights with big light output.","795":"Small than expected, looks like a toy, not a real big torch.","796":"Awesome for taking the dog for a walk at night.","797":"Great flashlight. I ordered several to give some as gifts - more stayed at our house than went out as gifts! Use 1 AA battery too which is nice. Easy to use rechargeables. Definitely recommend these if you want some small flashlights around the house.","798":"Very bright, neat can hold on a keyring  very helpful around the home etc.","799":"The model I recieved was a simple on\/off version not a hi\/low\/strobe. For the money it is well worth the 5 dollars with shipping. The light is built small and pretty durable. This is most definatly not 300 lumens but thats ok. Excellent for EDC, I keep it with me all the time. I would recommend if you are looking for a small but powerful flashlight.","800":"Very bright flashlight, I like this one so well that I ordered 2 more this past week. I don't use the pocket clip on it, but it seems quite sturdy.","801":"Got these for my boys for church camp.  Adjustable light is nice for spot or flood.  Seem really well made, especially considering the price.  Small and easy to pack is a great plus as well.","802":"Though these were cheap quality but they are metal and really brite.Very good item!","803":"Great flashlight.  Great price!","804":"For under 5.00 it works great.  Small and pretty bright.  Only thing I see that may be issue for some people is when you zoom-in it makes a sqaure type of the box from LCD.  Compared to some of the other cheap flashlights it works 5 times better.","805":"Very bright, very powerful, can focus the beamWorks much better than those 9LED jobbies from lowes for about the same priceChews thru a 14500 Li Ion battery pretty quick","806":"This light will take a single AA battery or the 14500 rechargable battery.  The light output and focusable beam make this an amazing package for the price.  I bought 4 and will be buying more.","807":"It is a great little flashlight. I work at a nightclub and you can change the focus so it's not so bright on peoples face. Or change it to superbright to signal someone far away. It clips on the belt good.","808":"Very Bright and very portable. Love that it comes in a two pack. Would purchase again.","809":"Great product!  Was very Impressed how much light they produce.  Perfect for walking my dog at night.  Feel a lot safer with these !!!!","810":"Good Deal.","811":"one worked one did not work","812":"I wish i bought ten of these.  They are bright, very solid, have a focusing beam, and exude quality.  I frankly don't know how they are made as cheap as they are sold for.","813":"Nifty product.  I bought 5 of these, scattered them throughout my house.  They're super bright.  I'm prepared for doomsday!","814":"This is an unbelievable little light. ONE AA battery and the light it throws out it is incredible. And the ability to focus the beam from wide to narrow is a huge plus.  Buying more as Xmas presents for everyone.","815":"I bought 10 of them. Just for my household. My friends like them so well, they bought them all from me. I need to order 10 more to replace the ones meant for my family at home.","816":"like most of other comments, it does the jobs as it intended. bright enough, small to carry around. Like the build, not sure quality, but push\/pull light is fun for kids. one AA battery design is great.","817":"Very bright and compact","818":"Great flash Light for a great price.","819":"This takes forever to get here from HK but I like the product itself. The focus slide works well and can focus the light down to a very small square (yes, a square).","820":"Decent enough light. But I hated the fact that I had to cyclce through the modes every time i turned it on.","821":"It's ok. Good amount of light although very narrow beam which doesn't adjust. Sometimes doesn't light up so you have to smack it a little bit before it'll turn on. Tried changing the batteries and same thing happens. It's just ok, but good for the price. It's no Nebo Redline.","822":"excellent flashlight I picked up a bunch of these share them with friends they love them good product and very inexpensive","823":"They both work great. Can adjust beam very easily.  Fast shipping","824":"This is a compact but powerful little flash light.  It fits in the palm of your hand, but lights up the dark with a powerful light for it's size.  I have purchased a few of them, I keep on in the car, house, backpack, etc...  It only needs 1 AA size battery.  I recommend it for it's power, compact size and great price.","825":"Its a lot brighter with duracell batteries. I belive there are better batteries for it but idk.","826":"Awesome light if you get this you'll like it I keep one in my room and one in the truck","827":"Light works well and has a powerful beam. The sliding mechanism is very cheap but so was the purchase price. Took many many weeks to receive my order from China but it dis finally arrive. Of course I paid with order.","828":"The build quality is great. The flashlight is super bright with a 14500 3.7v Li-Ion battery in it. I picked up several just to keep around the house \/ in my vehicles. At this price, don't hesitate and pick one up and see for yourself.","829":"Item arrived as advertised, coming from China.  Packed well, all four units operationally checked without any problems.  Gave 3 of them as gifts, and all raved at the mighty lite's performance....shoulda bought more.  I kept one and will use it as any emergency light in my vehicle.  Tough, well-built,  rugged-looking, and a steal at a bargain price.","830":"These are great little inexpensive flashlights that i keep in the vehicles and all over the house.  It takes one AA battery and puts out a lot of light for the size and the price.  I don't believe it reaches 300 lumens on regular batteries, but its plenty for everyday or emergency use.","831":"Really good for the price.","832":"One failed within 5 days.the on off switch stopped working","833":"Junk junk junk sums it up","834":"Great flashlights!","835":"Nice","836":"Good light at cheap price","837":"These flashlights are small but very powerful! I love them and are easy to have anywhere. I recommend this product.","838":"One works fine, the other was DOA","839":"I was hoping the flashlight would be brighter based on the description, but it's not as bright as advertised.","840":"They're bright but very small. Gets the job done tho","841":"Bright light, Good construction. Uses AA battery. Compact. Great price. This is almost a perfect light. The focus is too loose and a slight jar changes your light pattern. But overall this is a great light.","842":"You can't beat the value for the price on this flashlight. The case has a very solid feel and overall the unit has a good heft to it. The on\/off button is a little on the cheap side, but otherwise the quality seems quite good. The zoom simply slides forwards and back (no threads), which seems at first a little flimsy but in practice it means that you can hold the light and operate the zoom with one hand - very useful. Delivery took a 2-3 weeks to arrive from Hong Kong, so you need to be patient.","843":"Good buy for the price but are not as bright as other flashlights on this site","844":"Excellent flashlights.","845":"One worked. The second one I could not get it open to put the battery in so do not know if it works or not. one good one bad","846":"Muy bueno.","847":"These are great, light up the night, need to order 8 more!","848":"A good simple cheap bright light. I bought 4 of them to keep in the cars and in the junk drawer for when I need a light. Works well, and a great value.","849":"Wonderful and very bright product for the price.","850":"Thought they would be larger but works good..","851":"works great.","852":"Great Flashlight and packs a lot of power for something so small. Purchased a pair for $8. Went back to get more and price went up to $29!","853":"Quite sturdy & bright illumination. Telescopic part not much useful as it doesn't really create much definition.","854":"They are a lot brighter and much more solid than those \"free\" ones you can get at Harbor Freight.  The only downside is that you have to buy them....I like the focus feature too.","855":"These are awesome, one has already started shorting out. Also be sure to have a spare battery with you!","856":"With a house full of boys my flash light are always turning up missing. So I find myself looking for smaller but strong and bright flashlights. These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.Overall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight. It is small and light weight. Perfect to keep in your purse, car glove box or anywhere else you might need to.","857":"Great little flashlight.  Uses one AA battery.  Bright and very compact.  Can take it anywhere.  It has three modes: very bright, bright and a flashing mode.","858":"Flashlight works fine, but the clip is not connected with the right small screws -- when trying to use it the clip gets disconnected and the screws are falling out, But the price and flashlight functionality make this item a good bargain.","859":"Ive now purchased 3 of these and will probably own more in the future. I have only used standard AA batteries and they suffice.good purchase for the amount of money.","860":"I got a 2 pack on sale for like 8$. These are incredible little lights and being adjustable can focus on at a distance.","861":"Got them for all my coworkers who are required to carry a flashlight. Great units, and the bright orange tail buttons mean I can see when people are carrying them around in their bags. Excellent light for the money, didn't yet get the more powerful battery but that would almost triple the cost of the product.Great buy, wish they were made in the USA.","862":"Great little light. Well worth the money. Built well for a small light.","863":"Small and exquisite, easy to carry around.","864":"This little flashlight has the brightest, widest light I've ever seen.  I bought five more of them for the car, house, etc.  The price is unbelievably low.","865":"I carry this in my pocket everyday and it works great.  Very durable, good grip, good battery life and small enough that you harley notice it.  The adjustable beam is a nice feature.","866":"No problems at all ,strong lil lights","867":"A small and powerful flashlight with one AA battery. I really mean it. It is bright, and focus is adjustable. However, it is a bit heavy side if you are looking for something to fit in your pocket and carry all the time.","868":"You can't get a better light for the price!  This light uses a AA battery and the alkaline lasts way longer than my rechargeables li ions I have!!!","869":"weak","870":"I grew up with flashlights that had two giant D batteries. This little guy seems a million times brighter and it just takes one little battery. I use it all the time and the clip is handy to hang it. It's a solid-feeling piece of metal.","871":"Uses just one AA battery, features adjustable beam by sliding the front part with the lens.","872":"Most: size, uses 2A battery, adjustable light beam. Least: the method used to change the light mode.","873":"Nice small light and quality build. Has the ability to strobe and dim by a notch. Just tap the power button. Not as bright as another one but definitely brighter than these other lights bought at the store. I'm just running it on a aa. Only draw back is the length of time it took to get it. It was slow slow slow. Amazon goal was to shorten their shipping times by building warehouses and now charging taxes. This works against them. As most people I know they have started to look elsewhere.","874":"These things are bright. Really bright. The only complaint I have is that they are actually too small to hold comfortably. But light is bright, material is great and feels solid enough.","875":"Dropped it one time from about 3ft on to dirt and the piece that focuses the light broke. Will not buy these ever again","876":"bright and compact design. have them all thru out my house.","877":"For the price you just can't beat this little light. It's smaller and brighter than my Maglite XL50, uses ONE AA battery instead of 3 AAA batteries, and NEVER gets turned on accidentally in my pocket!","878":"perfect little flashlights!","879":"A most amazing little flashlight.  And it runs on just 1 AA battery.  I just ordered several more and will use them as gifts at Christmas time.","880":"This is an excellent flashlight for the size and price. Keep one in your car, home, bug-out bag. Only needs one AA battery, and has a focus zoom ... incredible.I got way more than I paid for.","881":"I had ordered 2 of these in a previous order and found them to be great. Really bright and solid. I ordered 4 more which took over a month to receive. These newer ones weren't as bright and the build is slightly different. The newer ones are slightly longer and the led looks different and is not even half as bright as the original 2. They are still brighter than my non led mini maglite so I guess I'll keep them.","882":"Flashlight would not turn off and almost burned my hand. It seems there is a short and the battery power is turned into heat in the handle!","883":"very cheap. Light does not go very far in dark. You get what you pay for. Fast shipment.","884":"This is the third time I've purchased these lights. Bright, well made, nice little units at a great price. I especially like that they just have ONE mode.","885":"The best thing on this phone is that it is sturdy and operates on one AA battery.  I don't dislike anything about this phone.","886":"Overall love the light. Only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me is that switching the modes around can be a pain because it switches the mode as soon as it is turned off.","887":"seriously, amazing for the price.  using 1 battery is also fantastic.  never have odd numbers of leftover batteries anymore.  I would buy more.  in fact, I bought 4.","888":"great little lights","889":"I don't tend to like magnifier focus flashlights but for under four bucks, I figured I'd get a few extra flashlights. These are fine. Of the three I received one of them seems to have a poorly threaded end cap, but it gets on there... QC, through Quantity, I guess they call it. Not going to bother with returns etc... as it works, and it wasn't worth any hassle sending it back. Magnifier is typical for a flashlight of this type. You can focus it until you can see the outline of the LED chip on the wall. Brightness is just average. My take is it's good for extras to throw in the tackle box or glove box, Nice for <$4 stocking stuffers, but of course, not even close to replacing a decent EDC type light (and of course, nowhere near the price). Ok for what it is, worth the price, don't expect more.","890":"Came in insulated envelopes within 2 weeks of ordering.  Decent performance thus far but of the 2 I bought, one is definitely a good deal brighter than the other.  I will try to update this rating as I use them more and give some more feedback on their durability and longevity after extended use.","891":"solid construction. very bright. it puts other led flashlights to shame at this price.  i had purchased a couple of these from another online retailer at a higher price so when i saw it here for less, it was a no-brainer to get a couple more.  i wouldn't hesitate to buy more if needed.","892":"it's worth 5 dollars of brightness.  it's small. light. and it's 5 bucks.  that's all i needed.","893":"Amazing light for such a small flashlight, I would have given it 5 stars but I bought 3 of them, on one the switch broke after short use.","894":"Excelente producto","895":"Died shortly after i got it. Eh.","896":"I'd love to rate these higher but they often seem to develop switch problems over time. Really too bad because they are great otherwise.","897":"Decent light output, especially for the cost.  Has adjustable focus, and uses standard, triple A battery. Can't go wrong for the cost, highly recommend!","898":"These are really nice bright little flashlights. They are very bright and easy to use for the small price. I like them.","899":"Excellent value for the money. Work great and is very bright for a little light.  I bought several and plan to put them in every car.","900":"I have surefire lights that are rated at 320 lumens, and this light does not even come close.I bought 3.  2 failed within a week.The \"zoom\" feature is really a cheap metal cylinder holding the horrible lens that slides forward and back which will eventually become very loose.In spotlight mode, the very center of the beam all you see is a square that is a reflection of the square CREE LED die and is very distracting.For a good pocket EDC light, get an Olight i3s.  yes, at $22 its a bit more than this light but it's reliable, has superior optics, is smaller, has terrific build quality , and will run forever on a single AAA battery.","901":"Nice Little flashlight,AA battery goes in the light The adjustable works good , The Mini Cree Led Flashlight Works For Me James L Bolen","902":"Quality machining on the case.  The Cree LED is bright, especially for the extremely low price.  The on\/off switch is recessed and VERY tough to click unless you have tiny hands.  That is pretty much a deal breaker, since turning it on and off with one-hand is a necessity for a pocket flashlight.","903":"One of the units does not work!!!  It should be replaced . There was no info as to who to contact. All the others work well.","904":"REALLY!!!  It uses one AA battery and has more power than a spotlight.  Buy it just to be shocked.","905":"very good Item... My recomendation 100%... only used a Battery....","906":"they did not come with any info.","907":"Awesome flashlights! Definitely recommend!","908":"This small flashlight puts out a very bright light that is surprising given its small size.  I like the hook so I can attach it to the corner of my pants pocket so it's readily available.","909":"I like that this is very bright in a very small package. Batteries run down quick, but since I use rechargeables that is ok. The Lion batteries are brighter than the AAs.","910":"This is a great little light. It is cheap to run on 1 AA and the zoom is excellent. However, the manufacturer's claim of 300 Lm is over the top, the actual brightness is about half (depending on type of battery). Keeping in mind the price and a single AA to operate - this is a fine value in a small light weight, zoomable, BRIGHT light.","911":"Great quality for the price!","912":"Great!","913":"love the AA, bright, use it everyday","914":"Affordable throw away lights that do the job. They're better than expected and you won't feel bad if you lose one.","915":"does not work","916":"These flashlights are basically free, and they are so bright they light up the room better than Liza Minelli's smile. I bought six for xmas gifts and they were well received.","917":"Absolutely love the flashlight, but it is not water resistant. The O rings are too loose. It let me down on a remote backcountry hike. It got damp in my daypack during a rainy day and would not work that night on the hike out.  I took it apart the next week. There was obvious moisture\/condensation around the LED. I let it dry out for a week and it started to work again. I believe the problem is with the seal on the focusing\/zoom barrel and in the seal between the lens and the barrel. I put silicon grease on the barrel to give a better seal and super glued the lens in place. Hopefully this will help some, but I never hike with this flashlight without a backup when it is damp weather.UPDATE:  got some more of these, and the second batch is better. The O ring on the zoom is much tighter. Maybe this is a fix, or just an example of loose quality control. If the zoom slides easily -- send it back. If it has some resistance, then the O ring seal is probably good.","918":"Excellent led , portable","919":"Great product!","920":"For the price, these flashlights are great.  They seem very durable as well.","921":"This flashlight has a lot of good things going for it.  It's inexpensive, bright, zooms, feels solid and looks rugged. I highly recommend it.","922":"It's a really cheap AA powered LED flashlight. I got a bunch to just have around. I wish the focus locked, but it was cheap and I'm still happy.","923":"For under $5, this flashlight packs a lot of light. The zoom function works well and the clip is solid. The different modes for low, high, and flashing work well but can be annoying sometimes. Overall a great product, especially for the price.","924":"These are truly incredibly bright lights. For five bucks  these are a deal. I have replaced all my old D cell flashlights with these. One AA battery, what a savings.","925":"I attached mine to my toolbelt and can quickly pull it out whenever I need some light.  The zoom focus works very well, and the LED light is super bright.","926":"The  on\/off button does not age well. It gets harder to turn (and keep) the light on as the product gets used.","927":"The brightest small flashlight I've ever seen.  Love that it covers a large circumfrance. Small enough to just pop in yyour pocket.","928":"Wish they were brighter. Have been very helpful around the house to look in dark closets or searching for things in the car. Good product.","929":"Great little flashlight for the money. I always keep a few extras at home to give as gifts. Very bright for its size. Great to drop in a pocket and forget until you need it.  Only drawback is that it takes a while to get since it ships from overseas.","930":"ok","931":"Excellent product.....excellent service.  This is a professionally made, durable product.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable flashlight.","932":"They work good but are small. Only about 3 inches each but still strong light.","933":"The flashlight looks sturdy and bright, but it did not have the adjustable focus zoom.","934":"Great little flashlights!","935":"Purchased 3 of these on special and they are great.  Had purchased one of these from a different vendor on another site and although they are the same \"model\" these ones are brighter and have a whiter light.  Great price for a great product!  Shipping was a little long but wasn't in a hurry so no big deal.","936":"They work great. Flashlights are small but do a great job of lighting up the area.","937":"Good size, great intensity","938":"Bought two of these simply because they were inexpensive. I was surprised at the sturdiness of the aluminum body. Time will tell if the three way end cap button will hold up as long. Expected delivery date was not met.","939":"We keep these in our vehicles, in the event we need a flashlight. You can find them on eBay for about the same price. Noticed these are a little bit of a cooler white then the ones of gotten off of eBay. They both has the same brightness. For the money, they really can't be beat.","940":"I was a little skeptical about this light, but it exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended for the small price. Although, it took over 3 weeks on a slow boat from China.","941":"Very good, with high and low bright","942":"Nice inexpensive torch.  Adjustable focus is inconsistent","943":"Well built, great value. Super bright. Like the zoom focus feature to widen or narrow the beam and the convenience of using a single AA battery.","944":"1 aa battery and this thing is so bright. Plus it ha three modes a full power mode a less power mode and a strobe mode.","945":"I have had other small flashlights but none compares to this one.  Excellent sight for long distances.  I have one in all my vehicles.  A must have flashlight","946":"Bought four of these, one failed on me but since they where so cheap It didn't bother me. I use 3.7 volt rechargeable battery's for extra kick.","947":"Very little and very inexpensive. Puts out an amazingly bright beam. The only drawback is it requires a special battery to get MAXIMUM light (a 3.7v battery that is the same size as a standard AA battery). However, it will work with a regular AA battery also. Two of the special batteries and the charger cost about $12.00.","948":"Handy little things to have around the house and in the car. Very bright.","949":"Works great","950":"The batteries in BOTH flashlights were no good.  It took 6 AAA batteries.  Not happy.","951":"Easy to carry, very light, and very bright!  I have used it extensively since I received it and it is now part of my every day attire.","952":"Super bright light in a small package.","953":"I keep buying them whenever I find them on sale, haven't been disappointed yet, great light output, single battery, zooming great feature.","954":"Great for the kids camping trips. Light is bright!","955":"Awesome flashlight! Solid construction and the light range is amazing. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.","956":"Very dim. Not worth the money.","957":"Great little flashlight for nightstand, car or travel.","958":"Enjoy the flashlight. Works great. Takes a few extra days to get the package. But they let you know that up front. So overall, I would recommend buying this flashlight","959":"Great little light that I keep in my day bag.","960":"MUY BUEN PRODUCTO","961":"They work as advertised.  It's a handy little light.","962":"We have lots of these and they work well.","963":"Received 2 flashlights. One worked fine, the other would not turn on","964":"NICE FOR THE PRICE","965":"Go for it . For the price you pay it serves the purpose. Very small and portable","966":"Not quite as nice as I expected. Rough edges and the anodizing was wore off in a few places. But was it worth the low price? Yes.Fast shipping, too.","967":"Compact size and clip make this a highly pocketable \/ portable flashlight.Is very bright -- brighter than my 100 lumen lights, but not too sure that it's rating meets specs.Overall a real deal.  Be prepared for a long ship date.","968":"This item for 10 dollars is so worth it!!! Feels like I'm using a 100 dollar flashlight so worth it ordering more!!!!!","969":"I had ordered 2 of these before for a gift and my personal use and both were great. I lost mine and reordered the same. This one fell apart within a week. It was definitely not built as well. It is worthless. I had intended to buy several more for stocking stuffers but not anymore since there the quality control is lacking.","970":"If all products were made as well as this flashlight the world would be a better place! The flashlight appears to be made so strong it looks like it is indestructible","971":"This thing is cheap, reliable, and very bright. If I would have a use for them I would buy more.","972":"Works great and even survived a hand washing submerged in water.My personal gripes would be when you focus the light it looks like a logo instead of a generic beam and between the different flashlights the \"logo\" isn't even placed at the same consistent angle. And I wish there was a option on the side to toggle modes instead of hitting the power. If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode. Minor stuff and I can't think of a multi-mode LED flashlight that isn't setup like that, but I sure with someone would set them up that way.","973":"Excellant light for the money, got three for around the house, etc. Rivals more expensive torches easily.Three more words.","974":"Great for light handy work or just to have in the glove box. I use it daily and the battery life is outstanding","975":"Although not as bright as the more expensive model, it's a lot cheaper and the light output is pretty good (only try with regular AA).","976":"Durable, lightweight and very bright","977":"Great flashlight, use it all the time. Also a great deal!","978":"Ridiculously small. You are mislead by the picture on the site.","979":"Budget light for a kid to destroy. Works good for keeping their hands off the good stuff. Lol","980":"This light worked great for camping seems to have great light output.  Uses jut one double aa battery great great","981":"Got this because it uses either regular AA or 3.7v 14500 batteries. It gives a nice bright white light. I would recommend this item to a friend.","982":"Not disappointed at all.  The wait for shipment from China was well worth it.Be sure and use the Lithium cells!","983":"Don't let the edgy design fool you. Very poor light for a flash light.  Gives off as much as much light as a 3 dollar harbor freight 2 pack.","984":"These are very cheaply made. Once of these broke after 2 uses.","985":"nice flashlight for the value.....","986":"Wow, can't believe how much light we get out of this little one.","987":"Got these as gifts.really bright and very solid.much more than I expected for the price.good deal, good light.","988":"Flashlights arrived just fine and focus function appears to be quite useful. I tried them all with AA batteries and they all tested just fine.","989":"Pretty good for the price. Very bright.","990":"No complaints.Very bright, and focus \/ zoom really works.Sometimes I worry that it may harm our eyes, so try to avoid getting light directly into eyes.","991":"One of the flashlights switch does not work.","992":"Awesome little flashlights!  One AA battery and your set. Very bright for the size.","993":"Great for the price!","994":"These lights are alot nicer than I expected for the price","995":"Though I received it later than the expected day, I still like it. It contains abilities that I expected such as mobile and durable. The light shape is also interested, it looks like a punch.","996":"Have given away several and have ordered more.","997":"This is surprisingly bright for the size.  I like how it uses a standard AA battery.  Works well and very portable.  I ordered a couple and the ones i received were gunmetal in color with an orange button.  Looks way better than the black one in the picture.  Don't even think twice, this is worth the money.  Not 300 lumen, but what do you expect for less than six dollars.","998":"Excellent quality.","999":"I love these flashlights. First I ordered 3 of them to see how they were. After I got them I liked them so much (and so did my friends) that I ordered 15 more!","1000":"Great little bright light!","1001":"I got this for my wife to use at night. WOW alot of light for such a small flashlight. I would recommed to others. Great price, Great product.","1002":"Great flash light","1003":"To be honest, I'm not impressed. I'm comparing these to my Streamlight Protac, which is also 300 lumens.Firstly, at first glance the construction seems fine. Quality of materials is ok.Secondly, there is no way in Hell that these flashlights are 300 lumens. I'd wager that they aren't even 100 lumens. Not bright at all.","1004":"super bright, and very handy. great buy for under $10","1005":"I have one for the car and one for my scooter.  One of the settings is rapid flashing.  I figure if I ever break down at night this will come in handy.","1006":"When this worked the light was awesome.  Very bright and good distance.  The switch on 2 of the 3 I ordered quit after a couple of months.","1007":"Awesome little light, highly recommend","1008":"I took a leap of faith and bought a couple of these lights and they emit a bright circle of light. The only other lights I have that compare to these are slightly brighter but come in at nearly 6 times the price. Definitely a good deal if you don't want to spend 30$+ on a flashlight.","1009":"First, shipping is ridiculously slow. Even it is from HK, it is much slower than other sellers on Ebay.The torch is a lite version, which means it doesn't have any modes(high\/low\/flash), just on\/off.I use a 14500 3.7v battery, but the light is still below my expectation. It should be a Q3 LED, definitely not a Q5, because I have a Q5 bought from Meritline. The reflector is pretty rough as well.For $5, no complaint. But I would suggest to spend 3 dollars more to get a complete version of this torch with quicker shipping.","1010":"nice light from one AA battery,but i've seen brighter.tough and waterproof nicely machined with clip.good value for the money","1011":"Awesome Light I love it Thank you Thank you","1012":"Super bright, can be focused down to a small point. 3 modes: super bright, not quite so bright and flashing. Come with no instructions of any kind, even the box the light comes in has no writing. Not that there's a lot to figure out; battery goes in, push button to light\/change mode. Great light, great price.","1013":"The light is strong and bright, the flashlight uses only one AA battery, it's amazingly bright. Highly recommend this product!","1014":"PROS: Integrated belt clip. Bright and works from far away with focus feature. Very durable.No cons!! Must have in your purse!","1015":"Its a good small flashlight. Well built and for a single AA battery. Very bright. Good buy. Recommended. Nuff said","1016":"Work well, good for the vehicle.","1017":"LOVE them","1018":"I use almost every day! I keep one in my truck and one in my bunker coat. Very bright and wide angle beam. upgraded to tenergy battery. much brighter!","1019":"This is a nice, bright flashlight with good battery life. However, only a few weeks after I got it the switch started to fail. Now if I turn it off I have to wait a while before I can turn it back on again, which is pretty annoying.","1020":"For the price, these are great!  Very bright for one AA battery.  Better than many of the higher priced lights I have tried.","1021":"Bright and adjustable.  The size makes it easy to carry.  Should serve my intended purpose well.  Should be water resistant.","1022":"sometimes the switch wont work but bright","1023":"For the price, I have not found anything that comes close to this light.It works well and has good battery life. I highly recommend it.","1024":"these things are great to have around","1025":"Best bang for the buck period! Great light output and lasts a long time. This is a must have item.","1026":"Perfect size and got flashlight!","1027":"Great little flashlight. Bright and adjustable for close up or distance.","1028":"short and sweet -- one worked, one didn't.they're pretty dim, granting powered off a single, AAA battery. That's only 1.5v. their rather small size is appealing for storage in an automobile or a purse, i suppose. those were the purchase designs here, anyway or it's highly unlikely would have gone this route.contacted the company twice, indicating one worked\/one didn't. IDK yet if they've responded; I don't manage this account. my wife's account and I'm the occasional buyer. that said, looking at the order history, there's no clear Amazon indication that any adjustments have been made.lastly, seems one can reasonably expect a hit & miss scenario with these -- notice the irregular pricing, strongly nudging a buyer toward a larger collection. to whit -- we bought a 2-pack for $9.99; now i see both that same 2-pack but also a 4-pack for $12.99.caveat emptor","1029":"these flashlights are awesome!","1030":"A very bright flashlight that allows me to see at long distances in the dark of night.  Highly recommended!","1031":"Can't beat this flashlight for the cost. Bright, reliable and well built. Worth the wait in shipping from overseas. First purchase was for three and since then I've purchased three more. Use them for work and at home.","1032":"This flashlight is cheap and is actually bright. Its great for around the house or in your car and you just can't beat the price.","1033":"Talk about handy!! These little flashlights really kick backside.....They are sturdy and super bright. I use these for camping, general use around the house and emergency lighting.I have put one in pretty much every room so that they are accessible.","1034":"Great little light. Takes a long time to deliver","1035":"Dropped the light one time. Now the slightest change in grip will turn it to strobe or off. But it's bright.","1036":"This flashlight is exactly what I wanted.","1037":"Excellent flashlight and a very good value.","1038":"Great light for the price.","1039":"Its a tiny led torch which is very handy on the go and even to leave it in the back pack. produces descent lighting for the price and i recommend this product if u r looking for a torch to make ur work done in a hurry","1040":"Great mini flashlight that packs a punch in brightness","1041":"great flash lights, 3 modes low light, bright light, and strobe","1042":"Great Product !","1043":"great lights","1044":"Perfect","1045":"For the money this light is bright and seems to be pretty well made. I plan to buy more of these.","1046":"No, you can't find the batteries at your local supermarket, nor do I believe you could find at Best Buy....","1047":"bien","1048":"small but good for price","1049":"EXCEED the EXPECTATION for the price I paid for.","1050":"My nephew told me about this light so I ordered 2 of them and could not believe how bright they are. Yesterday I ordered 4 more I highly reccomend this light for a ladys purse or night stand or a gift. Which is why I ordered more.","1051":"They are working good. I love it!","1052":"Fantastic value.","1053":"Pretty good for less than five bucks, seller was \"warm-mart\". The only mode is on-off, no strobe or low. I run rechargeable enloops in it and they can keep their voltage for an hour of constant use with no noticeable dimming. I'd imagine alkalines would dim much faster.I got another flashlight that takes 3 aaa batts from warm-mart, the quality on it is terrible","1054":"Mine came in a generic white box, no markings, no instructions, no battery.  It is not the multiple mode version also found on amazon.  The switch's only function is on\/off.  It draws ~330ma current.  The zoom function is a bit rough but the beam is quite even.  At it's widest it's still somewhat narrow.  For the fiver it cost, it's awesome.","1055":"Very bright and compact","1056":"Great product..","1057":"Awesome","1058":"I  love them , very compact and bright light.","1059":"good","1060":"These little lights are so good I love them they are so cheap but so bright great light to carry in your pocket at all times!!","1061":"Happy with purchase!","1062":"great lite","1063":"Nice bright light, built well.","1064":"Bright. 3 settings, strobe, bright and dim. Can focus light smaller.","1065":"excellent one of the best flashlights I have ever owned! For as small as it is, it's brighter than most of the big one's like maglites yet a fraction of the size and powers of ! AA battery","1066":"Great flashlight super bright and very portable. Seems to be built well, solid feel not the cheep plastic. For the price this is a steal.","1067":"Based on the good reviews, I bought this pack of two flashlights in preparation for Hurricane Irma, as I live in Central Florida. One of the two in the pack is defective. The on\/off switch does not work so that the light shines as soon as the battery is in and it cannot be turned off without taking out the battery.","1068":"cheap light works well","1069":"These little lights are very bright and just the right size to keep in your car or tractor or ATV.  I bought two.  For the price, you can't beat them.  Do expect to wait about a month or more for it to arrive form Hong Kong.","1070":"I bought 20 of these at $4.99 and gave them away as Christmas presents. I tested every one to make sure they worked. These all had the 3 mode switch and seemed very well built. I have one of my own I carry and use several times a day that was bought from another vendor but it only has on\/off. As one of the other reviewers said everyone should own one of these.","1071":"I have friends with similar sized flashlights that cost 10x as much but don't deliver 10x the brightness. Also, it takes AAA batteries?! SOLD!","1072":"They may be little but they are very very bright. I bought three of these and would love to have more. Caught them on sale.","1073":"Good product; sweet deal($); quick delivery.","1074":"Compact and solid","1075":"Not a bad flashlight.  I carry it as a backup to a surefire, streamlight, or ultrafire; depending on what I am doing.  I do not think it is 300 lumens and the one I received was not a multifunction light as was stated.","1076":"Great Quality ... Very durable","1077":"Absolute junk..Received the 2 lights today : 1 light does not telescope at all..The other turns to strobe whenever you put it downon a hard surface.","1078":"Light has a strong blue tint, lens is plastic, clip is cheap and won't last, overall \"feel\" is low quality. The light beam is poor and weak. Do not buy this product. It was totally disappointing.","1079":"Great Flashlight","1080":"The model I received did NOT have the adjustable focus. The round lens protrudes slightly beyond the end,and the power button protrudes slightly from the other, making it impossible to stand up straight on a flat surface on either end, which I consider a semi-epic fail. I bought some of these in 2012 with the adjustable focus, and I like those particular units better. This one seems to be slightly lighter than those as well (perhaps more plastic).In operation, I can't distinguish one as being brighter than the other, both appear almost identical in brightness and beam width, checked outdoors at night.Shipping was slow, ordered on July 11 and received on August 4, but I knew that going in.For the two reasons in my first paragraph above I am knocking off 2 stars.","1081":"Great deal","1082":"Bright","1083":"This thing is amazing for the price!!","1084":"Powerful enough and handy tools to run quick inspections of my car.","1085":"Great little light.  It has a tight, CRISP focus (~4\" at 6') and is much brighter than I expected it to be.Three fuctions: High, low, and strobe","1086":"Gooooooood","1087":"Great","1088":"Not quite the equal to a similar model I purchased from a different source.The brighter unit has a second lens under the outer one. This one appears to have a bubble lens mounted directly on the emitter instead.","1089":"Great little flashlights!!! Been giving them as gifts!!! Very pleased with product and service!!! Thanks Again!!!  Love the flashlight and they are very bright!!!","1090":"Awesome light and wicked bright","1091":"This little light is incredibly impressive. Heavy weight, feels high-quality. Beam adjustment works well. Shipping takes a while from overseas. I will definitely buy this again.","1092":"I only need the 3,7v. battery to make this a 300 lumen flashlight. This is a very compact light,and I like the adjustable beam.","1093":"Good cheap flashlight.","1094":"not bad, but buy two. You will need back up.","1095":"Awesome flashlights!","1096":"It was just as described","1097":"prompt shipping and great item","1098":"nice","1099":"I order this little flash light to replace  the one I order from eBay I have problem with the switch I hope this one don't have the same problem price is good fast service I recommend to my friends...thanks","1100":"I got this in June of this year.  After less than four months, it's broken.  Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more.  My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.This flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little.  If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.Oh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc.  Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.One other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything.  That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.Move on...get something else. Anything.  A glow stick would be better and last longer.","1101":"Shipment is very fast and on time.  The price is right.  Love the product and it works as expected.  Thanks.","1102":"One of the flashlights worked great right out of the box. The second light had an issue with the focusing collar. Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried  pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time.","1103":"Yes, just ok.  Runs on a single AA battery.  Ok light in a pinch.  We're not talking about a zillion lumens, by any stretch.  But, click the button, the light goes on.  Simple three mode mechanism.  Adjustable bezel, push\/pull, to adjust beam size.  Flood setting looks best, but not the brighest.  Worth the buy, in case of an emergency. Besides, AA batteries are cheaper than dirt, and so easy to find.","1104":"Product as described, shipped promptly.","1105":"Nice flashlights. Carry in your pocket. Simple to use. Push the button, it's on. Zoom works well.","1106":"The clip fall off the crystal is made out plastic and to get a brighter light I yum a different battery inside.","1107":"ran over it with a forklift still works fine nothing broke off of it","1108":"Great little flashlights!!!","1109":"I use these for security and they are perfect. Not too big but very bright.","1110":"These are great. The light is extremely bright.","1111":"Good light for price. But only outputs 200 lumins not 300 lumins as advertised. Overall review is 4 star .","1112":"Very good.","1113":"Neither flashlight worked.  Checked my batteries in another light , problem with Rockbirds flashlight ,","1114":"Best yet","1115":"Awesome shine low price about 12 hours on a battery","1116":"Great flashlight. Small but powerful.","1117":"perfect","1118":"I am very impressed with how well built this little flashlight is. The pocket clip is very strong and the entire light seems very well made. For it's size it does a good job of lighting things up.","1119":"Works really good","1120":"One of the three flashlights did not work","1121":"Very good very good","1122":"I took pictures of one of my bright (almost) pen size flashlight and this one prrojected on my ceiling so u can see how bright it is. Finding a way to post them.","1123":"ty...I like","1124":"Cant beat this light for the price. solid and super bright. I got 3, and i think i need 3 more.","1125":"Great item thanks","1126":"Great little lights. The only two downsides are that the clip is tempered and will break if you try to bend it a little more so it's easier to clip on your pocket. The other is that when you turn it off, and then back on it goes to the next mode. So if you turn it off on the bright setting and turn it turn it back on, it'll be on the low setting. The modes are bright, low, & strobe. So I just switch it to strobe before I turn it off, that way it comes on bright. Not a deal breaker for me. But for some it might be.","1127":"This light was dimmer than I thought, but it works for a good house light. Don't buy if you're looking for ultra bright tactical.","1128":"Bright & dependable bought two 1 for car & 1 for network bag just right spot working in network closet","1129":"It telescopes, it had 3 settings bright and dimmer and flashing. It's really bright for a one AA battery flashlight. The clip is durable and  fits clips right onto my pocket or my belt. Totally recommend and I can't believe this item was so cheap.","1130":"This is my go to EDC light for work(pest control and environmental health inspections). Waaaay brighter and more durable than you'd expect from a 4 dollar light.","1131":"Delivery and packaging was great but the item is poor quality, cheap feeling although it has a metal body.  When screwing on the cap to battery compartment the metal sheered on the threads.  I do not imagine it will be very long lasting.  The light is good, though the pinpoint beam, I expected, would be more spot focused, it is still a fairly wide beam","1132":"Don't get fooled down by the price\/size.This flashlight is really bright and is really handy....I would definitely suggest this flashlight.","1133":"They're cheap, but you knew that already. They're definitely not streamlight flashlights, but I mean, for the kids to have in their pocket while we're camping, who cares. They put off a square light. They squareness dissipates some as you zoom it. If you want a cheap couple lights for the kids, grab these. But for your car or backpack, I'd spend a bit more.","1134":"great little flash lite I use rechargeable batteries 1.2v  they work great they last about a week on daily use","1135":"great Flashlight ,","1136":"Junk. One had the on off button quit working after a few uses and the other won\u2019t turn on half the time. Oh yeah and sometimes it just blinks and blinks and won\u2019t shut off. Have to take battery out to shut it off.","1137":"compact and work great.","1138":"I'm happy with it. I've only tried a previously used AA battery in it, I don't yet have a 14500 and charger. Simple on\/off button controls, and focus\/zoom allows you to transition from spot to flood. With more experience with reliability, battery life and battery types, I may be back to give this another star.","1139":"After a long time of carrying these disappointments I am glad to say I can buy a new flash light. They are okay for throw away flash lights but they are very undependable and aren't really worth keeping for more than a week. I run a small business that requires me to constantly use a flash light and I bought these as a test run. After about a week they started going in and out. I replaced the batteries and still it only worked about 45% of the time. I'm not a picky person but these had a pretty bad short in their switch so I just kept them in a drawer and used them intermittently. Glad to say though they are finally dead as a door nail and I can replace them with something a lot better.","1140":"Very bright for its size, can out shine many flashlights twice its size, and it's well built in metal casing, not to mention it looks great as well.  Can't go wrong!","1141":"Incredibly dim. The rubber on the button is warped and bubbled. I found metal shavings in the threading of the battery chamber. Did I mention that it is so dim it's pathetic? I was going to give this as a gift but after trying it out I would be so ashamed if I had given it. Other than the metal shavings, warped rubber button and a pretty poor battery fit it does feel like it does feel like it is a well built flashlight, too bad that its so weak at actually producing light.","1142":"Excellent!!!  Buy 5 for the house and car.","1143":"Awesome light! Very bright and perfect size. My husband loves it.  It took a while for it to arrive though.","1144":"Slick.","1145":"very good","1146":"ProsBright lightLight is adjustableIt has good weight so feels like it won't smash apart when dropped.Don't have to hold down the button to keep the light onCons:Clip not all that useful","1147":"I am no flashlight expert so I can't comment on the brightness or battery powered life but for $5 and free shipping you better believe it is worth grabbing and setting next to your bed or on walks and night with your dog.","1148":"excellent flashlight thank u...........","1149":"SMALL ENOUGH TO CARRY IN YOUR POCKET TO BE READY WHEN YOU NEED TO LIGHT UP A PARTICULAR SITUATION.  IT HAS HELPED ME  NUMEROUS TIMES.","1150":"great little adjustable flashlight. very bright and easy to carry along in my backpack when ever i need it. just found out about the different brightness settings, so cool!","1151":"Horrible lights!! The lights change modes with any bump of the flashlight. I cannot keep them on one mode without them changing modes from power saving to flashing to high beam. Every single bump or vibration will change modes and cause the lid to come off and the battery pop off! Cheap and not worth the money!","1152":"It is a powerful, acceptable workmanship flashlight.Great small flashlight for all purpose usage.Can't beat the price for this performance.","1153":"It was EXACTLY what I wanted! I could NOT find any flashlights like this anywhere. I HIGHLY recommend it if anyone is looking for a small pocket flashlight with a BIG BRIGHT LIGHT & adjustable Focus Zoom. It's the best I have ever found!!","1154":"The light is very bright and have long distance. Its very small so it can be portable in a pocket. Its excellent, i will buy another one.","1155":"I already had one & liked it,wanted to get additional ones, however these are a little different .It doesn't pulse on the 2nd click as expected.","1156":"For the price you can't beat it - very bright and seems durable.  Perfect for your glovebox - would recommend to anyone.","1157":"the product is very good for this price. I did not expect something better. I am using it about six month and i am very satisfied.","1158":"I purchased these flashlights to add to my bug out bag that I carry in my car. They're small, good quality, and only require 1 AA battery. It has a zoom in\/out feature that is very handy. I also like that the power on and off button is at the end of the flashlight for quick access, whereas some other lights I've purchased have them on the side. My husband is using one for when he takes the dogs out to use the restroom at our apt complex and likes it.","1159":"Pros:Fairly good build qualifyGood floodSingle AACons:Poor spot1 W with AA NiMH3.5 W with 14500 lithium ionPoor efficiencyTechlite LumenMaster at Costco is a bettery deal when on sale (3 for $15)","1160":"Very solidly made. Very bright and the beam is easily changed from concentrated to broad by sliding the lens. Runs on one AA battery which is easy to change. The LED is easily changed as well if needed. There were two in the package. The main problem is that there are three modes: bright, dim and bright strobe and you need to cycle thru all of them to get to the one you want. Every time you turn it on. It does not stay on the last mode used.","1161":"Batteries last a long time and its super bright and rugged.... Not much more then that.  I would recommend it","1162":"Great light for the money!  No instructions whatsoever with light, thus I had to try various battery sizes before realizing 1 AA was all i needed.  The beam will reach out far when you pull the focus zoom lens out.","1163":"Since this product was shipped from Hong Kong i was expecting that it would take about 4 to 6 weeks to arrive, but it came in the mail in about 3 weeks. Very compact only uses one AA, bright and durable, I would recommend this item.","1164":"A very good and built product for the price. Great product...and it only works on a single AA battery.It has a high output and bright light that you can zoom in and out, low light to save the battery power and strobe.","1165":"I had to get a flashlight that fitted my 1\u201d light mount for an upcoming airsoft skirmish. Thought I might as well get a combo pack! These little things pack quite a punch, and they\u2019re tough. There not fully water resistant but they lasted through some rainfall and condensation. The lens is also quite thick because I also drop them on a concrete floor and not even a slight scratch. I ended up using them periodically over a time span of 7 hours in below 26\u00b0 F weather and haven\u2019t notice them go dim. Would recommend them because of the great value!","1166":"Tough little light. Good price","1167":"I was expecting too much out of these little guys. Ad says 300 lumens if im remembering correctly. Id say theyre more around 90-110lumens. 3\/4 have scratched lenses which isnt too much of an issue but considering theyre scratched on the inside, it could come as a concern to others.","1168":"Great brightness, very well made.Well worth the price .Would buy again. Hopefully bulb lasts for a long time . It should as its LED.","1169":"This is a prize! I carry it with me where ever I go; have dropped it a few times--but it is tough and I am starting to depend on it alot.","1170":"A few cosmetic blemishes, but works well.  Great deal for the price!  Mine came marked as UltraFire \/ CREE.  Thanks!","1171":"Powerful!","1172":"When turning these on, you get a different mode each time. Who wants a flashlight that shines a random mode each time? I use the same mode 99% of the time so have to change modes every time I turn it on. No thanks.","1173":"It came with everything seemingly OK.  The bulb was bright, but after a few days use, the bulb became dim which makes the flashlight useless.","1174":"Unexpected quality for a flashlight under $4.00. I use a 14500 rechargeable battery and it is very bright. The zoom is a nice feature. I have recommended this to everybody I know. Shipping was faster than stated.","1175":"The light is brighter than other LED lights I've owned. What's amazing is how uniformly bright the light is. It creates an almost perfect white circle of light. No brighter at the center or edge.","1176":"I had purchased one of these around Christmas time for my girlfriend. it put ALL my other compact lights to shame, so much so i kept \"borrowing ' hers. Now their is one in each car and I have my own!!","1177":"I have a similar single AA focus light I got from China. This one is better machined, brighter, and has a smoother focus.","1178":"Great product, took sometime to receive, but once i got it, i was amazed how well built it was and how bright it was and im using regular AA batteries.  Its a great little light to carry around, and for the price you cannot go wrong","1179":"Purchased from Aukey in early February, it arrived quickly (shipped from California to California). Flashlight was as described, including fully adjustable focus. It appears well-made and durable, and despite daily use and withstanding a few drops, the only signs of damage are some small scratches.Pros: Very bright, apparently durable after ~1 month ownership. Good battery life. Appears water resistant but I haven't cared to test that.Cons: The clip is very stiff. It's near-impossible to clip onto my pants pocket one-handed, and a bit difficult to unclip. I might be able to bend it away slightly, but I haven't tried.Overall very happy with the flashlight, will likely purchase more from the same seller as gifts.","1180":"This light is very bright and while its not a surefire or even a fenix, for the price you just cant beat it.  I keep one in my truck and have used it more than a few times with no problems.","1181":"Great little light to carry in tiny storage under my motorcycle seat.","1182":"Uses 1 AA battery which is why I bought it.  AAA batterys are too weak for consideration.Seems bright enough.  I'll likely buy another one.","1183":"I got three of these. For the price...why not. I gave one to my son... age 8 years old.It lasted less than 24 hours. The other 2 are still working.","1184":"I ordered the rechargeable batteries along with this. It eats the batter FAST and gets really hot after a few minutes of use. But hey, for the price I can blind someone 100 yards away.","1185":"Ordered 2 packages - 4 flashlights total.  One of the push button toggle switches works only when it feels like it - and it's not often it feels like it.  The other 3 flashlights work okay, but I wonder how long before their push button toggle switch craps out.This is the first time in 14 years of shopping with Amazon that a product we purchased doesn't work.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.It's not worth the hassle to send a $4 flashlight back. It should be thrown away, but then I'm throwing away $4 of my money.  It's not the money, it's the principle.  Come on Amazon, just suck it up and mail me a working replacement.","1186":"Solidly built, takes a beating. Only complaint, and it is minor, is that a regular AA will wear down fairly quickly.","1187":"So far this flashlight is great. Very bright for the money and just one aa battery. If it lasts without breaking for awhile it is well worth the money...as much as some very higher priced flashlights.","1188":"Very bright light for a small price! I'm very pleased with my purchase. I even have some friends that are wanting one now.","1189":"I like the lights very good","1190":"These are so much brighter than I expected! First of all, love that there are two. But the fact that there are different settings makes it a hit with the kids too! Personal flashlight for kid = win. It means that she can handle things on her own despite it being darker in the house than she prefers. On a less personal note, though - Small\/portable, easy to use, super bright. Love it!","1191":"nice litle flashlight, very bright, good quality, strong built only need one AA battery, cheap compare to other flashlight I had.","1192":"An amazing light for the price. I buy lots of edc lights for testing and this is up there with almost all of my 30 to 40 dollar lights","1193":"It took a while to arrive, but it was worth the wait!","1194":"This is a great little light for the money, will order a few more soon just to have around the house.","1195":"I have used one of these a lot for QC inspection on and off several times a day its still working.","1196":"I don't like the modes that it forces you to cycle through. I have to click through dim and flasher modes before I get to the regular bright mode which is all I wanted in the first place. For the price it's a marginally ok product.","1197":"My friend showed me this flashlight. Very bright and at a really great price. I will buy more to have around the house and cars.","1198":"Even with a AA alkaline battery this flash light is bright. It is solidly built. The weight of the flashlight fooled me into thinking it already had the battery inside.","1199":"I took this flashlight to Costa Rica with me and it survived wonderfully. Extremely bright and with the telescopic extension, reaches a great distance. Light and portable. Love it.","1200":"Bought 8 of these for Christmas presents.  Nice light output with the AA battery.  Very compact and fit easily in a pocket.","1201":"This is a surprisingly good flashlight, especially for the price.","1202":"save your money if you drop them they don't shut off anymore both are broke in less then a week","1203":"I like this flashlight, for the size, it's very bright.  If you tap the switch lightly, it changes modes, You can pull  the front lens, and zoom from wide to narrow beam. I gave it 4 stars just because the bottom cap (with switch) has very poor tread. at the beginning I thought it wouldn't hold it close with battery. But it does so far.","1204":"I figured, what the heck. Took a chance only due to the fact it has an adjustable beam. Light output it pretty weak in my opinion. The clip broke immediately. The only thing this has going for it is its size. Go to Costco and spend 15$ on a pack of three flashlights WITH battery's!","1205":"This little light is very bright and a great deal at around $5.... I keep it in my glove box and am considering purchasing another one.","1206":"Very very bright. I love this little light. And the zoom feature is even better to use. You will not regret it","1207":"From a flashlight afficianado, super bright! Adjustable focus as well. Compared it with the brightness of my other mini flashlights and it far exceeds!","1208":"inexpensive and really bright use it all around the house working and for camping. I haven't had it long I hope it lasts because I like it","1209":"Awasome light.","1210":"Didn\u2019t work even tried several batteries","1211":"For the price and how far it traveled, this thing is amazing.I love how it is adjustable and heavy.I have one in my backpack and one in my car.","1212":"not quite sure of the exact 300lm as advertised, but this is one bright little flashlight. I bought several to keep in different areas of the house.","1213":"This is an outstanding little flashlight. Very well made and very bright. I immediately bought 8 more for Christmas presents.","1214":"The tail cap button worked for maybe 4 clicks, now refuses to turn on. After clicking it about 20 times the flashlight might turn on, sometimes takes more clicks. On brand new battery it puts out less light then a 30 lumen flashlight. Sliding focus is useless. Light throw is about 10 feet at best. Maybe a faulty unit but I wouldn't recommend this flashlight at all.","1215":"Very bright, perfect size, no complaints. Insert a AA battery and you're good to go. I wish it had included a battery, but for the price I have zero complaints.","1216":"As advertised, zoom lens to change pattern, 1 aa battery, nice and bright. I have had it for a while and it has held up well.","1217":"Good cheap backup light to have.  Light weight, adjustable and flashes also.  Use it several it's and have not had any problems.","1218":"Even with the cost of a rechargeable battery and charger, I spent very little compared to other lights of this quality. Very pleased with this light!","1219":"Good brightness even with AA battery but it doesn't adjust the beam as advertised.  Feels solid in the hand and the clip appears solid.","1220":"Quick shipping.Flash light is week compared to other 300 lumens flash lights.  This may be due to the fact that it uses a single AA battery.Not recomended.","1221":"We are simply delighted with this little powerhouse! As far as we're concerned, it is plenty bight and blows regular flashlights away. I was rather amazed at the light beam (adjustable) it offers. The scalloping on the nose protects the lens. I recommend using a rechargeable AA battery because it uses a bit of power to provide that nice beam. BUT after one uses the little powerhouse, the button on the end gets messed up and you have to disassemble it to get the loose spring properly aligned again. This happens with both of the ones we bought. They really should be pulled from the inventory because this issue really compromises the usability of the flashlight. Clearly bad design.","1222":"Small but powerful, just a nice little light to keep on my computer desk.  The adjustable feature is a nice tool.","1223":"Worked great for a short while, then completely stopped working.  Probably didn't use it more than six or seven times.  Save your money.","1224":"Great value, compact, bright and adjustable.  Uses single AA battery.  Drawback is at the smallest focus beam its not round","1225":"I bought one of these. Doesn't seem any brighter than older flashlights that claim to be 1W 100 lumens. I am very dubious about the advertised spec of 7W 300lm.","1226":"You can't believe the light that comes out of this small device.It uses one AA battery and is adjustable from a spot to lighting the whole room.","1227":"Great little light.As good as lights costing ten times as much.Only uses one AA battery.Going to order more.","1228":"Nice product, very bright, cheap, you should buy batarrys by yourself. You should remember that it has only one switch mode!!!","1229":"These flashlights are junk. They are supposed to work on either AA or Rechargeable 3.6V batteries. If you put the AA battery in there is very dim light. No better than a pen light you can pick up anywhere. If you put in the rechargeable battery, the flashlight only works for 10 minutes, gets hot and quits. I bought the first 3 lights from EggDeal. It took 5 weeks to receive them, and they looked like a quality product. So, I went back to the same location and ordered 5 more, for gifts. In addition I ordered rechargeable batteries and a charger. The 5 I received this time (Tosol 8888) were garbage. No names on the sides, poor paint jobs, dirty lenses and rough machining. The rechargeable batteries wouldn't work in these lights either, and they were even dimmer on AA's than the first batch.Now I' m stuck for the $25 I spent for batteries and a charger, as well as $30 I spent for these lights. Guess I should have heeded the other one star reviews.","1230":"This light is a knockoff of an earlier 300lm cree i purchased from what initially thought was the same seller... The original Cree 300lm will have \"Ultrafire\" clearly stamped on the side and the beam is non-adjustable. Also the on\/off button is completely different. This light is junk compared to the real Ultrafire. So pissed right now cause i gave the Ultrafire away to my father and now im stuck with this POS knockoff. So, in summary, if your light came with no stamping and is adjustable you got screwed.","1231":"Very bright and cheap.  I like the 3 settings bright, dim, and blinky.Seems durable, and perfect to keep in the car.","1232":"One of the flash light stop working after about a month to use. It seems like the switch problem to something internal. Not recommendable","1233":"Exactly as described, and more. Well engineered item, water resistant 100%. Super bright white beam. Battery easy to replace. I will buy again - these make excellent gifts for friends and family (just make sure you order them some AmazonBasic AA batteries too :-)","1234":"I've grabbed quite a few of these low priced flashlights over the years.  These ones are very nicely put together.  The button has a comforting sense of durability when you click it and I hope that translates into it not failing prematurely as some others have in the past.  The overall build quality feels nice and solid.  The light level with AA's is satisfactory, and exceeds that feeling when you factor in the cost and size of the light.  There are some small purchases that leave you feeling like you got a better deal than you expected, this was one of those.  Great light for a cheap price!","1235":"what an awesome product for such a great price. I definitely recommend for buy. Took awhile to get though. :)","1236":"A++ easy to adjust. Takes only one battery makes it more better. Very durable like it And will recommend To purchase one","1237":"Compact, bright, and only one AA battery is required. Zoom is a nice feature, as well as being water resistant.","1238":"Well one worked great , the other one did not work since day one, was not so bright and just went off. Got a new battery and turned on and then off. DEAD NOW...SO , I WOULD NOT BUY! DID I MENTION THAT WE got HIT BY MARIA? YEAH AND REALLY NEEDED IT!","1239":"I would say this light is somewhere in the neighborhood of ~100 lumens when on a 1.2 volt AA battery. The build quality is acceptable, just. The slide feels loose but it doesn't feel like it's going to come off or anything. It also has a really weird clip which I have removed because it was too tight. It was also much smaller than I expected but that was just ignorance on my part. And to confirm all the other reviews it only has 1 mode. (well 2 if you count 'off' lol)","1240":"much brighter with the 14500 battery, but still adequate with the AA. i like the switch, just an on\/off switch, not strobe.","1241":"All 4 I ordered worked perfect.  Nice bright light with the ability to focus or spread the beam.  I'd buy again.","1242":"I bought one for myself for hurricane season.  Bought a second one for my friend who's a cop, she love it!","1243":"Really good for the price, solid construction and small. It just took a while receive it. But I was in no hurry","1244":"Only received one light in my order. The one light is nice for the price but I paid for two","1245":"If i could give this product a zero i would. Absolutely terrible trash. Have yet to work properly. Wish i could have returned them. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.","1246":"The square beam is a trade off I am willing to make for this $5 edc. The adjustable slide is very smooth","1247":"OMG! I love these flash lights!  I originally I got these for my survival kit. I put one in my survival pack and the other one in my purse.  I use the one in my purse all the time!  My purse is so big, I loose things!  Lol!","1248":"These are as good as any light I have used. I live in the woods and they light up the country side. I have one on my shotgun and it works great.Super compact size allows for east carry and mounting on a weapon.","1249":"these are super bright, need only one common AA battery. fit easily in glove box or center console of car. they don't weigh hardly anything so I imagine ideal for a purse as well. I'd purchase again in the future","1250":"Product arrived DOA.  Seems to be a current fad with this piece of merchandise.  Waiting to see if I will get another one sent to me or what.","1251":"I didn't expect much, but I did expect to receive a product that functioned as advertised. This light has no way at all to focus the beam. For now it works up close, but spreads so much at a distance as to be useless.It turns on and off, but just about the time you can feel the button under your finger the switch opens and it turns off. If I was to bet on it, I'd say this switch will stop working within a couple of weeks. I'd send it back, but it's not even worth the effort.JUNK.","1252":"These lights seem to have issues after a little use but as to be expected from a low priced light. It\u2019s good as a light for the kids or in a tool box but don\u2019t plan on performance.","1253":"Can\u2019t even get a battery in it. And it\u2019s not bright at all once I finally got the top open. It just kept spinning and spinning. Now I can\u2019t get the batteries out","1254":"Great price for the same basic light I had purchased for a higher price from another vendor.  Excellent! Small, lightweight and light stream can be narrow or wide angle.","1255":"would not buy again. why to small.  i guess i need to read description better or measure better.  these are sooooo small.  They work ok too but just to sarn small.","1256":"This company's service is very good, the product if there is a problem they will bear the responsibility, is a trusted company!","1257":"I work at a hospital, at night. These work perfect when I don't want to disturb my patients and wake them up with a bright light. They are so cute and fit in my pocket of my uniform. I also keep one in my purse.","1258":"The light sucks, it is nothing close to 300 lumens unless you buy a specialty battery that most don't have or won't buy. Not to mention the movable head to change focus. The tip of the flashlight moves from the body in and out to allow focus. This is not needed and only creates another movable part to break.","1259":"No instructions as to how to open and replace batterys, they did not light when button was pressed.","1260":"I ordered 2 of these, one showed up missing a screw on the clip, the second has screws that do not stay in.  I ordered these because of the clip.  I will epoxy new screws in, but I should not have to with brand new merchadise","1261":"Not impressed. These aren't much better than the dollar store flashlights, not very bright, as the high dollar flashlights are.","1262":"Perfect size for purse or glove box. Great for carrying on night walks. Would give 5 star but i prefer sa wrist strap added.","1263":"A OK flashlight for the price good for  fishing  hunting and outdoor activities  Like the fact that it's  made with a metal material  very bright  Love the belt clip  Good product","1264":"These flashlights are OK. Nothing special.For as cheap as they are, I don't suppose you can set your sights too high!","1265":"ProsIt was inexpensive. $5Lasts a long time on a single AA battery.Uses AA batteries as opposed to AAA.Feels well made.Being able to adjust the beam from focus to flood.Nice light output considering its size and single battery.ConsThe price went up. Otherwise its a fantastic little flashlight.","1266":"Ordered 5, all 5 are now in the garbage. They don't last very long and seller would not respond to messages. =(","1267":"the reason for the low rate is because of the long wait for the delivery of this product....maybe I can rate it better when It is delivered and used","1268":"I bought these to use as a bike headlight. My commute to work is about 20min., which I do by bike after dark 3-4x\/wk. I always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drains the battery less than a steady beam, and is legal for a bike headlight in Florida. At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge. I tried the 2nd light, and had a similar experience. Not wanting to continue risking my life, I tried to return the item, but it was not eligable. I am very dis-satisfied.","1269":"Great for the price.","1270":"Hate it because I love it. I have not received it yet. I got one in the past and I loved it and decided to buy five more for myself and friends, but it's been a month and they are not here. They are definitely on a slow boat from China.","1271":"I have the older version of this flash light and it is nice and bright but the new one blows it away.  To get the really bright light you need the 3.6v lipo battery.  With a AA battery it is not as bright as with the lipo battery.  A regular AA battery is only 1.5v and has a lower current output.  Highly recommend these flash lights.","1272":"Great little flashlight. It works well and is very bright for its size.","1273":"I've purchased 6 of these before. this is the first one that didn't have the 3 function power switch. This seems to be a common issue but people never realize there are several sellers of this light. This one I bought from seller tosell888. He had the longest shipping time and no 3 function switch. The light also doesn't seem as bright as my other 3 function units. I would say its in between the hi\/lo setting of the 3 function using a lithium energizer aa battery.","1274":"BOTH flash lights stopped operating in less than a week!  I have had excellent service life from other LED merchants.  No excusefor such dismal performance.  Steven Belaus","1275":"after the First time using the flashlight it fell out of my pocket and it hasnt worked since.","1276":"i was really surprised how bright they were and they only take 1 AA battery per flashlight","1277":"Very bright light, non adjustable beam","1278":"Not bright at all but handy enough","1279":"they stop working!!!!"}}
